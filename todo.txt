Build a project using RAG and fine-tune the LLM model.
Important: run a model locally, please don’t rely on any hosted API (e.g. OpenAI’s ChatGPT API). load and infer the model locally. develop a quick prototype

use Phi-3 model

download latest quantum physics papers as documents to train and fine tune the model
