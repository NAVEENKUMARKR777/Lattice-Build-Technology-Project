    "summary": "Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.",

    "summary": "Implementing large-scale quantum algorithms with practical advantage will require fault-tolerance achieved through quantum error correction, but the associated overhead is a significant cost. The overhead can be reduced by engineering physical qubits with fewer errors, and by shaping the residual errors to be more easily correctable. In this work, we demonstrate quantum error correcting codes and logical qubit circuits in a metastable ${}^{171}$Yb qubit with a noise bias towards erasure errors, that is, errors whose location can be detected separate from any syndrome information. We show that dephasing errors on the nuclear spin qubit during coherent transport can be strongly suppressed, and implement robust entangling gates that maintain a high fidelity in the presence of gate beam inhomogeneity or pointing error. We demonstrate logical qubit encoding in the $[[4,2,2]]$ code, with error correction during decoding based on mid-circuit erasure measurements despite the fact that the code is too small to correct any Pauli errors. Finally, we demonstrate logical qubit teleportation between multiple code blocks with conditionally selected ancillas based on mid-circuit erasure checks, which is a key ingredient for leakage-robust error correction with neutral atoms.",

    "title": "POPQC: Parallel Optimization for Quantum Circuits (Extended Version)",
    "summary": "Optimization of quantum programs or circuits is a fundamental problem in quantum computing and remains a major challenge. State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and even exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a weaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural number $\\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the oracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls to the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to oracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential.   In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of quantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set of fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\\Omega$-deep circuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in rounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the segments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the invariant. For constant $\\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires $O(n\\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$ is the number of rounds. We prove that the optimized circuit returned by the algorithm is locally optimal in the sense that any $\\Omega$-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to the oracle.",

There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\\\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.",

    "summary": "Continuous-variable (CV) systems have shown remarkable potential for quantum computation, particularly excelling in scalability and error correction through bosonic encoding. Within this framework, the foundational notion of computational universality was introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1784 (1999)], and has proven especially successful since it allows for the identification of finite sets of universal CV gates independent of the encoding scheme. However, achieving the critical objective of fault-tolerant computation requires some form of encoding, and to date there has been no proof that these universal CV gates can lead to encoded fault tolerance. We present compelling evidence in this direction by utilizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. Specifically, we numerically optimize the generation of GKP states from vacua using circuits comprised solely of universal CV gates. We demonstrate that these states can be attained with sufficient quality to exhibit error probabilities lower than the threshold needed to achieve a fault-tolerant memory via concatenated GKP-stabilizer codes.",

Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.",

Their high erasure thresholds relative to their resource-state cost establish them as promising candidates to replace surface codes in the context of FBQC. Examples include protocol families using 8-, 10- and 12-qubit resource states, with erasure thresholds of 13.8%, 19.1% and 11.5%, and footprint-per-logical-qubit scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(d)$, $\\mathcal{O}(d^{1.46})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(d^{0.58})$, respectively, where $d$ is the code distance.

We indeed study the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuit commonly used in QNN applications and contrast it to those of two classes of states that can be efficiently simulated classically: matrix-product states (MPS), and Clifford-enhanced MPS (CMPS), obtained by applying a set of Clifford gates to MPS. In addition to expressibility, we assess the level of primary quantum resources, entanglement and non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. \"magic\"), in random ensembles of such quantum states, tracking their convergence to the Haar distribution. While MPS require a large number of parameters to reproduce an arbitrary quantum state, we find that CMPS approach the Haar distribution more rapidly, in terms of both entanglement and magic.

Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.",

Estimating excited-state energies is challenging for classical algorithms due to exponential scaling with system size, posing an even harder problem than ground-state calculations. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues and singular values of parameterized matrix families, including solving generalized eigenvalue problems that frequently arise in quantum simulations. Our method uses quantum amplitude amplification and phase estimation to identify matrix eigenvalues by locating minima in the singular value spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithm by proposing a quantum-computing formulation of the pseudospectral collocation method for the Schr\\\"odinger equation. We estimate fault-tolerant quantum resource requirements for the quantum collocation method, showing favorable scaling in the size of the problem $N$ (up to $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{N})$) compared to classical implementations with $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, for certain well-behaved potentials. Additionally, unlike the standard collocation method, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem requiring matrix inversion, our algorithm circumvents the associated numerical instability by scanning a parameterized matrix family and detecting eigenvalues through singular value minimization. This approach is particularly effective when multiple eigenvalues are needed or when the generalized eigenvalue problem involves a high condition number. In the fault-tolerant era, our method may thus be useful for simulating high-dimensional molecular systems with dense spectra involving highly excited states, such as those encountered in molecular photodynamics or quasi-continuum regimes in many-body and solid-state systems.",

At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space.

To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals.

We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\\sim$20$\\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be \"free\" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of \"free\" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.",

    "summary": "The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.",

The performance of QESA is evaluated based on the approximation ratio and the Hamming distance, relative to the graph size. The analysis shows that QESA outperforms standalone SA by leveraging a warm-start input derived from two types of Rydberg atomic array experimental data: quench evolution (QE) (implemented on the Quera Aquila machine) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) (using the experimental dataset archieved in K. Kim et al., Scientific Data 11, 111 (2024).

The parametric oscillator has complex eigenfrequencies due to non-Hermiticity with two origins: parametric amplification and dissipation resulting from the loss of photons to a continuous field. In situations where the oscillator is close to the parametric resonance, and the coupling to the driving field is strong enough for a complex eigenfrequency to lie in the upper half of the first Riemann sheet, the number of photons of the parametric oscillator and the continuous field increases exponentially. The parametric amplification is counteracted by dissipation due to the coupling of the parametric oscillator to the continuous field, and if the dissipation is sufficiently strong relative to the amplification, the exponential growth is suppressed. The suppression occurs when the complex eigenfrequency responsible for the exponential growth moves into the second Riemann sheet analytically continued beyond the branch cut of the Green function on the real axis along the continuum of frequency. As a result, there appears a stationary photon emission, where creation of photons balance with dissipation due to emission of the photons to the continuous field. Then there is a constant flux of photons, with the number of photons in the continuous field increasing in proportion to time, while the number of photons in the parametric oscillator remains constant.",

This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment.

However, dephasing processes, manifested as photoluminescence (PL) linewidth broadening, pose a limitation to photon indistinguishability. In this study, we use a custom built confocal scanning microscope to examine the temperature dependent PL spectra of GaN defect quantum emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses, with the goal of elucidating their dephasing mechanisms. Our experimental findings show that at low temperatures, the PL lineshape exhibits a Gaussian profile with a constant, temperature independent linewidth, consistent with spectral diffusion. As the temperature increases, the PL lineshape evolves into a Lorentzian, and the temperature dependent linewidth deviates from the common T3 law. Considering the Debye temperature of GaN (about 600 K), the experimentally observed temperature dependent linewidth can be modeled by the quadratic Stark effect modulated by acoustic phonons in defect rich crystals. Furthermore, this model exhibits a level of accuracy comparable to that of the defect-E2(low) optical phonon coupling model previously reported in the literature. Our work reveals the mechanism of acoustic phonon induced dephasing in GaN defect emitters and demonstrates that both acoustic and optical phonons can contribute to their dephasing.",

We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other.

Theoretical modeling reveals sublinear standard deviation growth (merely N increase for N equidistant segments), enabling preservation of sub-picosecond stability over extended distances. We experimentally validate this approach using a three-station cascaded configuration over 200 km fiber segments, demonstrating strong agreement with theory. Utilizing independent Rb clocks at end and relay stations with online frequency skew correction, we achieve time stabilities of 3.82 ps at 10 s and 0.39 ps at 5120 s.

Understanding these intrinsic constraints is essential for the preparation, manipulation, and measurement of multi-photon states with LONs. Although several properties of the multi-photon state have been shown to be invariant under LON unitary evolution, their physical interpretation remains elusive. Here, we introduce a Hermitian transfer matrix approach to explore the multi-photon evolution, revealing that the overall state purity decomposes into three distinct invariants -- each arising from either single-photon dynamics or the multi-photon interference. We experimentally observe these purity-like invariants by preparing distinct initial states, applying LON unitaries, and measuring the resulting invariants.

We show that this feature manifest in the non-stationary noise spectrum of outgoing light as additional peaks structures, although resolving these structures in practical experiments requires a larger number of repetitive trials with our sampling parameters, which is cost-prohibitive. To address this issue, we further employ statistical inference methods to extract more comprehensive information, thereby reducing the required number of experimental repetitions. Through Mock-Data simulations, we demonstrate that only 10 experimental trials of 40 seconds each are sufficient to reduce the false alarm rate for distinguishing between the two models to below one percent.",

This Time Crystal prolongs the coherence time, hence, it is used for quantum computers as qubits. Therefore, we established the method to exploit Time Crystals for quantum computing by controlling external noise called Quantum Time Crystal Computing and demonstrated solving the problem of generating correct waves using Quantum Reservoir Computing, and fitting of given function using Quantum Neural Network and Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. As a consequence, we revealed that Quantum Time Crystal Computing lower the accuracy of Quantum Reservoir Computing and improved the accuracy of Quantum Neural Network and Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network.

By examining amplitude damping and random telegraph noise in both zero and finite temperature regimes, the study reveals nuanced distinctions in the degradation and revival of quantum correlations. The interplay between intrinsic spin couplings, thermal effects, and memory-induced coherence backflow highlights the complex behavior of quantum resources under realistic noise conditions. Concurrence emerges as a sensitive marker of entanglement recovery in dephasing environments, while uncertainty-induced nonlocality proves more resilient in high-temperature or dissipative regimes. The analysis further demonstrates that moderate thermal activation and external magnetic fields can nontrivially enhance or suppress quantum features depending on system parameters. These findings offer a detailed perspective on the robustness and complementarity of different quantum correlation measures, providing guiding principles for the design of thermally stable and noise-resilient quantum information protocols.",

In comparison with the single-tone drive, except for the blockade of the $(n+1)$th photon excitation due to large detuning, the key mechanism in this scheme is the sequently resonant excitations of all the $m$-photon states ($m\\leq n$) by the $n$-tone drive, which lead to the enhancement of photon generation and the demonstration of multiphoton blockade in the weak driving regime. Moreover, the photon distribution within the system can be adjusted on demand by tuning the relative amplitudes of the driving fields for different frequencies. The scheme can be extended to other bosonic systems and be applied to demonstrate other multiphoton physical effects.",

While atoms were eventually accepted (even by Ostwald himself), the emergence of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity were crucial to suggest that the dismissal of energy in favor of atoms was perhaps premature, and should be revisited. We discuss how the so-called primitive ontology programme can be implemented with energy as the fundamental entity, and why fields (and their quanta, particles) should rather be considered as non-fundamental.

The effect has branched off into a variety of different interpretations, making it easy to miss the unifying features of the underlying effect. In particular, the quantum Zeno effect has been studied in the context of both selective and nonselective measurements; for both pulsed and continuous interactions; for suppression and enhancement of decay (Zeno / anti-Zeno effects); and even in the absence of measurement entirely.   This concise review presents a unified picture of these effects by examining how they all arise in the context of a driven qubit subjected to measurements or dissipation. Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are revealed as regimes of a unified effect that appears whenever a measurement-like process competes with a non-commuting evolution. The current landscape of Zeno and anti-Zeno effects is reviewed through this unifying lens, with a focus on experimental applications and implementations. The quantum Zeno effect is found to be both ubiquitous and essential for the future of near-term quantum computing.",

Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$.

We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.",

    "summary": "The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of reconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for reconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial transpose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot joint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively implementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.",

This third term vanishes when the state and observable commute, and thus represents a purely quantum contribution arising from coherence disturbance and measurement backaction.

The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections.

    "summary": "Trying to export ab initio polaritonic chemistry onto emerging quantum computers raises fundamental questions. A central one is how to efficiently represent both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom on the same platform, in order to develop computational strategies that can accurately capture strong electron-photon correlations at a reasonable cost for implementation on near-term hardware. Given the hybrid fermion-boson nature of polaritonic problem, one may legitimately ask: should we rely exclusively on conventional qubit-based platforms, or consider alternative computational paradigms? To explore this, we investigate in this work three strategies: qubit-based, qudit-based, and hybrid qubit-qumode approaches. For each platform, we design compact, physically motivated quantum circuit ans\\\"{a}tze and integrate them within the state-averaged variational quantum eigensolver to compute multiple polaritonic eigenstates simultaneously. A key element of our approach is the development of compact electron-photon entangling circuits, tailored to the native capabilities and limitations of each hardware architecture. We benchmark all three strategies on a cavity-embedded H$_{2}$ molecule, reproducing characteristic phenomena such as light-induced avoided crossings. Our results show that each platform achieves comparable accuracy in predicting polaritonic eigen-energies and eigenstates. However, with respect to quantum resources required the hybrid qubit-qumode approach offers the most favorable tradeoff between resource efficiency and accuracy, followed closely by the qudit-based method. Both of which outperform the conventional qubit-based strategy. Our work presents a hardware-conscious comparison of quantum encoding strategies for polaritonic systems and highlights the potential of higher-dimensional quantum platforms to simulate complex light-matter systems.",

    "summary": "We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \\Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \\sim V \\sim \\Delta) \\gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.",

We explore two types of feedback: \"link-level\" and \"path-level\". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path.

We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.",

    "summary": "Imaginary time evolution is a powerful technique for computing the ground state of quantum Hamiltonians, where the convergence to ground state in asymptotic imaginary time is guaranteed. However, implementing this method on quantum computers is challenging due to its nonunitary nature. Here, we propose a fully quantum approach for simulation of imaginary time evolutions which eliminates the need for intermediate classical computation or state tomography. Our method leverages the recently introduced state-based quantum simulation technique, in which using quantum states besides quantum gates allows to simulate a broader class of evolutions beyond the natural quantum dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate how by using a set of quantum states and by applying only controlled-SWAP gates and measurements, one can simulate the nonunitary imaginary time evolution. We illustrate our results in an example.",

However, QML models also inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to help understand why and how a particular output was generated.   This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and quantum-classical loops.

We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies.

In this approach, the two-dimensional quantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low speed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian parameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among metric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as minimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that it is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory describes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to discriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single detection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination strategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper time corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between the energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed. It is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the success probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the highest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this, atomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.",

    "summary": "A photonic quantum memory capable of simultaneously storing multiple qubits and subsequently recalling any randomly selected subset of the qubits, is essential for large-scale quantum networking and computing. Such functionality, akin to classical Random-Access Memory (RAM), has proven difficult to implement due to the absence of a versatile random-access mechanism and limited multimode capacity in existing quantum memory protocols. A potential path to developing the quantum analog to RAM is offered by photon-echo protocols in rare-earth ion-doped materials, such as Revival Of Silenced Echo. These can utilize optical rephasing pulses to selectively read-out frequency multiplexed photonic qubits within an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. However, the conventional non-adiabatic nature of the rephasing pulses requires intense, short-duration pulses, impeding their fidelity and multimode capacity. To address these critical limitations, we introduce an alternate protocol that employs Rapid Adiabatic Passage (RAP) rephasing pulses, to realize quantum memory, which invokes phase-imprints to suppress undesirable echoes. Using the optical transitions of a $^{171}{\\rm Yb}^{3+}$:${\\rm Y}_2{\\rm SiO}_5$ crystal, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of multiple intricate spectro-temporally photonic modes and achieve optical random access memory across eight distinct spectral modes. This protocol yields greatly enhanced mode-mapping versatility while substantially lowering the required rephasing pulse intensity, providing a more efficient and reliable approach for high-fidelity qubit storage and retrieval.",

Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.",

This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications.

A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays.

At zero temperature, we analytically identify a set of points (interaction strength $\\times$ their duration) that minimize the simulation time.

Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail.

Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.",

    "summary": "It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of \"meter\" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating.

In this configuration, the magnetometer bandwidth is enhanced by almost two orders of magnitude as compared to the open-loop setup. Incorporating an injection transformer, the proposed system effectively reduces current noise to below 3 nA/sqrt(Hz) over a broad frequency bandwidth, independent of DC-current offsets. Analysis of the system sensitivity reveals that the performance is currently limited by technical noise. If this were to be eliminated, the system would achieve a current sensing sensitivity on the order of few pA/sqrt(Hz), while maintaining perfect galvanic isolation from the target circuit.",

    "summary": "The search for non-ergodic mechanisms in quantum many-body systems has become a frontier area of research in non-equilibrium physics. In this Letter, we introduce Hilbert subspace imprint (HSI)-a novel mechanism that enables evasion of thermalization and bridges the gap between quantum many-body scars (QMBS) and Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). HSI manifests when initial states overlap exclusively with a polynomial scaling (with system size) set of eigenstates. We demonstrate this phenomenon through two distinct approaches: weak symmetry breaking and initial state engineering. In the former case, we observe that ferromagnetic states including those with a single spin-flip display non-thermal behavior under weak U(1) breaking, while antiferromagnetic states thermalize. In contrast, the Z2-symmetric model shows thermalization for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. In the latter case, we engineer the initial state prepared by shallow quantum circuits that enhance the overlap with the small target subspace. Our results establish HSI as a mechanism equally fundamental to non-thermalization as QMBS and HSF.",

In the regime of truly long-range interactions (small fall-off rate), optimizing over local unitary operations, while retaining the local measurement scheme in the original measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) set-up, enables the scheme to achieve nonclassical average fidelities. Specifically, we identify a threshold fall-off rate of the interaction above which the fidelity of both universal single- and two-qubit gates consistently exceeds $90\\%$ accuracy. Moreover, we exhibit that the gate-implementation protocol remains robust under two realistic imperfections -- noise in the measurement process, modeled via unsharp measurements, and disorder in the interaction strengths.

It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings.

Remarkably, this quantity is independent of the specific gate being implemented, highlighting a universal property of the battery itself. We show that minimizing the unitary defect, under given physical constraints on the battery state, is mathematically equivalent to solving a Lagrangian optimization problem, often corresponding to finding the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum system.

This work presents a new formulation for a single electron in a general electromagnetic field based solely on differential operators that simplify existing formulations. A gauge-dependent equation is derived first using Moyal's equation. A transformation of the Wigner function, introduced by Stratonovich, is then used to make the equation gauge-invariant, which gives us a strong formulation of the problem. This equation can be transformed into its weak form, which proves that both formulations are equivalent. An analysis of the different properties of the gauge-dependent and gauge-invariant formulations is given, as well as the different requirements for the regularity and asymptotic behavior of the strong and weak formulations.",

Motivated by this approach, in this work, we extend the framework of quantum reference frames to incorporate superluminal Lorentz transformations. We apply this conceptual result to examine an apparent paradox where particles acquire negative energies after undergoing a superluminal Lorentz boost and propose a resolution within our framework.

This is due to the fact that only a few analytical treatments exist, and that the language of quantum mechanics is built for linear operators. For instance, the very formulation of the quantum adiabatic theorem requires the underlying dynamics to be linear. In this work we show that in a generalized Landau-Zener model, nonlinear dynamics can be leveraged to suppress excitations and coherences of the corresponding linear scenario. To this end, we introduce a generalized \"energy spectrum\", which is defined by the expectation values of the energy under the stationary states. As a main result, we show that the nonlinear term in the evolution equation acts like an effective shortcut to adiabaticity for the linear Landau-Zener problem.",

This Quantum Information Resource Constraint (QIRC) reflects an exclusion principle intrinsic to Hilbert space: optimizing one task necessitates sacrificing others. Crucially, $q_1, q_2, q_3$ are experimentally measurable, making QIRC falsifiable in quantum platforms. Unlike abstract quantum resource theories (QRT) that quantify resources through entropy or monotones, our framework is fundamentally operational, deriving tight constraints from measurable task fidelities in teleportation, cloning, and metrology. The emergent \\(\\ell^2\\)-norm exclusion is irreducible to existing QRT axioms.

Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range Neel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method ``the bipartite fluctuations''.

On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exist yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of energy spectrum, such as spectral compressibility $\\chi$, and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension $D_1$ of the Shannon--von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here we study physical systems subject to local and non-local hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the banded random matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports validity of the simple relation $\\chi + D_1 = 1$ in all systems under investigation. Hence we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings we derive a universal function $D_{1}(r)$, where $r$ is the averaged level spacing ratio, which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.",

Employing a microscopic, analytically solvable model, we perform a comparison of these two perspectives, revealing substantial differences in the thermodynamic quantities and in the formulations of the first and second law.

This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register.

    "summary": "Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Fidelity of entanglement (which measures the proximity to a maximally entangled state) and various quantum entropies are key indicators for certifying entanglement in a quantum state. Quantum states with high fidelity are particularly useful for numerous information-theoretic applications. Similarly, states possessing negative conditional entropy provide significant advantages in several quantum information processing protocols. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two indicators of entanglement, both in state and channel regimes. First, we present a comprehensive analysis and characterization of channels that reduce fidelity of entanglement beyond a threshold limit of bipartite composite systems. In this context, we introduce the notion of fidelity annihilating channel and discuss its topological characterization, along with various information-theoretic properties. We then provide a comparison between channels that diminish the fidelity of entanglement and negative conditional entropies. Extending our analysis from channels to the state level, we further examine the relationship between the fidelity of entanglement and various quantum entropies for general two-qubit states. We derive the upper bound on R\\'enyi 2-entropy, conditional R\\'enyi 2-entropy, Tsallis 2-entropy, and conditional Tsallis 2-entropy, in terms of the fidelity of entanglement. Finally, we explore the relationship between relative entropy and the fidelity of entanglement of a two qudit quantum state.",

    "summary": "Quantifying quantum entanglement is a pivotal challenge in quantum information science, particularly for high-dimensional systems, due to its computational complexity. This thesis extends the geometric measure of entanglement (GME) to introduce and investigate a suite of GME-based entanglement monotones tailored for diverse quantum contexts, including pure states, subspaces, and mixed states. These monotones are applicable to both bipartite and multipartite systems, offering a unified framework for characterizing entanglement across various scenarios. Notably, the proposed monotones are adept at identifying entanglement with varying entanglement dimensionalities, making them particularly effective for detecting high-dimensional entanglement. To support practical computation, we develop a non-convex optimization framework that yields accurate upper bounds, complemented by semidefinite programming techniques to establish robust lower bounds. Together, these approaches provide a consistent and efficient computational methodology. This work advances both the theoretical understanding and algorithmic tools for entanglement quantification, contributing to the study of complex quantum correlations in entangled systems.",

Here we demonstrate that impulsive spin-dependent excitation can be used to perform high-fidelity non-local entangling operations in quasi-uniform chains of up to 40 ions. We identify a regime of phonon-mediated entanglement between arbitrary pairs of ions in the chain, where any two pairs of ions in the chain can be entangled in approximately 1.3-2 centre-of-mass oscillation periods. We assess the experimental feasibility of the proposed gate schemes, which reveals pulse error requirements that are weakly dependent on the length of the ion chain and the distance between the target qubits.

Current approaches to this problem fail to converge on the optimal solution due to a phenomenon known as vortex formation. In this work, we present an efficient optimization algorithm using Optimal Transport. Our approach completely bypasses the creation of phase vortices and allows for a state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show a deep theoretical connection between the Optimal Transport plan and the ray-optics limit of the Wigner distribution of the unknown complex-valued field, and show that our method can be used to retrieve the phase-space transformation of any unknown quadratic phase system. Finally, we reinterpret this problem in the modern quantum learning framework.

But convex conic subsets resulting from presence of linear constraints allow extremal elements of rank > 1. The problem of deciding when a matrix is rank-1 generated, i.e a sum of rank-1 PSD matrices, has been studied extensively in optimization theory. This rank-1 generated property acts as an entanglement criterion, and we use this property to find novel classes of PPT entangled states. We do this by extracting a matrix from the density matrix, and show that for all separable states, this matrix satisfies the rank-1 generated property. In general, the same is not true for the corresponding matrices of PPT entangled states. We also extend this approach to construct PPT entangled edge states. Finally, we provide different methods that detect the violation of rank-1 generated property.",

    "summary": "We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem.

For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems.

The probes act as decay channels for the excitation, and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement on the network dynamics. By making use of a Genetic Optimisation algorithm, we demonstrate that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task, revealing a tradeoff between the number of probes and the required computational power.",

First, quantum error correction (QEC) circuit are instances of dynamic circuits, and therefore a compatible QEM can extend circuit depth and address errors that QEC struggles with. Second, recent studies show dynamic circuits can significantly outperform purely unitary ones. However, mid-circuit measurement errors remain a major bottleneck. Current solutions rely on readout noise characterization, which is vulnerable to temporal noise drifts. We propose a drift-resilient protocol for addressing preparation, mid-circuit, and terminating measurement errors without requiring calibration or characterization. One scheme uses parity checks of repeated measurements (suitable for superconducting qubits), while the other leverages reset and feedforward (suitable for trapped ions). We demonstrate our methods experimentally on IBMQ and Quantinuum hardware. Combined with the Layered-KIK gate error mitigation protocol, this readout mitigation approach enables 'End-to-end' mitigation for dynamic circuits, which can improve the outcomes of QEC experiments. Other applications of the presented methods include a faster alternative to gate-set tomography and diagnostics of defective qubits during the execution of the target algorithm.",

We bound classical strategies via convex polytopes and present a study of their symmetry, demonstrating that the vertices are inherently connected to K-juntas as defined in the classical theory of Boolean functions, while their facet inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with oracle games. We then analyze the violation of the \"fingerprinting inequality\" achievable by the use of one quantum particle, and we study the dependence of this violation on the dimension of the particle's internal degrees of freedom.

However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes.

Applied to spacetime, this finding yields a generalization of Noether's theorem: the specific pattern of energy-momentum non-conservation on a generic curved spacetime, encoded within the quantum field theoretic scattering matrices, is sufficient to calculate the metric. Applied to quantum gravity, this shows that the conventional dichotomy of spacetime versus matter can emerge from an underlying information-theoretic framework of only one type of quantity: abstract correlators, $G^{(n)}$, that are, a priori, merely operators on $n$ tensor factors of a Hilbert space. This is because, on one hand, if abstract higher-order correlators $G^{(n>2)}$ can be diagonalized, these correlators can be represented as local quantum field theoretic vertices on a curved spacetime whose metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ can be explicitly calculated. On the other hand, at sufficiently high energies, such as the Planck scale, the $G^{(n)}$ may not be even approximately representable as correlators of a local QFT on a spacetime, indicating a regime that is mathematically controlled but transcends the concepts of spacetime and matter.",

However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments.

We show that in general quantum systems, these correlators obey properties similar to those of von Neumann entropy and capacity of entanglement, both of which are special cases of these correlators. Then we specialize to two spacelike-separated spherical subregions in conformal field theories. We present direct computations of the vacuum two-point function that confirm its equivalence to the stress-tensor conformal block. We explore the two-point function in various kinematic regimes, including imaginary time separation between subsystems. The material presented in this note may be useful for further studying modular Hamiltonian correlators in generic quantum systems and in conformal field theories, including those with holographic duals.",

    "summary": "Searches for the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have high discovery potential for violations of time ($T$) and parity ($P$) reversal symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry-violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when its nuclear spin is $I\\geq1$. We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments. We provide qualitative estimates of parity doubling from EQMs and supporting \\textit{ab initio} calculations, along with implications for candidate molecules in symmetry-violation searches.",

    "summary": "Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally, inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing, retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics, including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs. Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.",

    "summary": "According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environment in the quantum regime where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent exploration toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also review the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.",

    "summary": "A quantum trajectory is the natural response of a quantum system subject to external perturbations due to continuous indirect measurement. We completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of continuously monitored quantum systems in finite dimensions and show that generically, spontaneous irreversible localization transitions on the level of individual realizations occur, where the evolution becomes effectively constrained to one of the irreducible components of the total Hilbert space. More generally, localization can be either complete, where the strongest possible confinement is achieved, or incomplete, where localization terminates prematurely. On the trajectory level, symmetries and conserved quantities are no longer respected and localization transitions occur concurrently with violations of ergodicity. As a result, a generalized update rule emerges that effectively projects the system onto one of several possible time evolutions. The update comes equipped with a generalized Born rule that assigns probabilities to these irreversible events. Spontaneous transitions thus occur probabilistically and can deviate considerably from the behavior of the ensemble. In particular, time and ensemble average no longer commute which gives rise to global violations of ergodicity, while on a local level, ergodicity is restored. We explicitly illustrate the asymptotic behavior of continuously monitored systems in a series of examples demonstrating stabilization of many-body scar states and generation of Bell states from local measurement. Finally, we present two algorithms, one based on simultaneous block diagonalization and one based on quantum trajectories to identify all the minimal orthogonal subspaces of the Lindblad equation and all the extremal stationary states which are supported on them.",

To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable.

Our protocol enables exact embezzlement of arbitrary bipartite pure states using a single, fixed catalyst state.

The construction is explicit, based on simple *-automorphisms acting locally on infinite tensor products of CAR algebras with the underlying idea of the Hilbert hotel. In the dense-state case, the protocol naturally recovers the Type III_1 factor via the GNS construction, consistent with recent classification results. We further extend the construction to allow exact embezzlement of all states, at the cost of working with a non-separable C*-algebra. Despite the increase in algebraic size, the operational structure remains simple and localized.

By turning on the nonlinearities, gain and losses are switched on, enabling flexible generation of both quantum entanglement and quantum steering in our proposal. These generated quantum correlations seem to be insensitive to the induced gain, while the induced losses through saturation effect efficiently enhance quantum correlations. Moreover, the robustness of the generated quantum correlations against thermal fluctuations is further improved under nonlinear saturation scenario. This work suggests a way of using nonlinear saturation effects to engineer quantum correlations even at room temperature, which are useful for quantum information processing, quantum computational tasks, and quantum technologies.",

Recent technological advances in phase and polarization structure have led to the discovery of high-order PB phases with structured light fields. The study on the high-order PB phase is limited in the context of elementary quantum states of light, especially in the case of photon number states. Here, we experimentally investigate the differences of high-order PB phases between single-photon and N00N states. Our results show that the PB phase, like the dynamic phase, can also be doubled under two-photon states, which can greatly improve the phase sensitivity for greater $N$ in N00N states and high-order structured photons.

As a case study, we focus on the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\\tau \\to \\pi \\nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.",

Mediation analyses revealed a very small negative indirect effect of explanations on attitudes, through lower perceived comprehension, and a very small positive indirect effect of explanations on attitudes via increased actual comprehension - though the latter was counteracted by a negative direct effect. As metaphors offered no additional benefit over non-metaphorical explanations, the findings suggest they do not provide a communicative advantage for enhancing understanding or shaping attitudes in this context.",

The strong orientation dependence through the zero-field splitting (ZFS) interaction in the single-quantum transition is overcome by coherently driving the significantly narrower overtone transition. Analytical formulas for the overtone lineshape and nutation functions for axially symmetric ZFS interactions are derived. Overtone Rabi oscillations are observed in pentacene-doped \\textit{p}-terphenyl and NV$^-$ centers in microdiamonds. For the former, overtone triplet dynamic nuclear polarization using the integrated solid effect leads to a $^1$H nuclear spin polarization of $0.183\\pm0.005$\\% at a magnetic field of 0.2 T. The $^1$H NMR polarization is enhanced by 2600-fold with respect to thermal equilibrium and reaches a large portion of the randomly oriented microcrystals.",

    "summary": "Recent progress in ultrafast optics facilitates the investigation of the dynamics of highly multimode quantum states of light, as demonstrated by the application of electro-optic sampling to quantum states of the electromagnetic field. Yet, the complete tomographic reconstruction of optical quantum states with prior unknown statistics and dynamics is still challenging, since state-of-the-art tomographic methods require the measurement of many orthogonal, distinguishable modes. Here, we propose a tomography scheme based on time-domain quadrature correlation measurements and theoretically demonstrate its ability to reconstruct highly multimode Gaussian states. In contrast to (eight-port) homodyne detection, the two local oscillator pulses are shorter in time and are (independently) time-delayed against the pulsed quantum state. The distinguishable mode structure is obtained in post-processing from the correlation measurement data by orthogonalization. We show that the number of reconstructable modes increases with the number of time delays used and decreases with the temporal extent of the local oscillator. We extend and optimise our proposed correlation measurement to electro-optic sampling by adding a nonlinear crystal prior to the homodyne detection, potentially achieving subcycle resolution in the mid-infrared to THz regime. By analysing the (quantum) correlations present in the measurement data, we show how thermalisation of the quantum state during detection leads to the requirement of correlation measurements. The thermalisation is especially pronounced in the strong squeezing limit, for which we developed a non-perturbative theory. Furthermore, we open an avenue to extending our tomography scheme to non-Gaussian states by theoretically establishing the complete measurement statistics and showing how to obtain spectral information about pulsed Fock states from the joint statistics.",

The code is a nonstabilizer code, and is also a nonlinear quantum error correcting code, meaning that quantum information is encoded in a parameterized family of quantum states, rather than a linear superposition of code words. Syndrome measurements are performed by projecting on states with differing total spin, with an associated correction to map states back to the maximum total spin space. We show that the code is asymptotically capable of protecting against any single qubit Pauli error for Gaussian distributed states such as spin coherent state. We directly evaluate the performance under the depolarizing channel, considering various cases, with and without initialization and measurement errors, as well as two qubit errors.

For such free-space quantum communication, the brightness of the quantum light source plays an important role due to the atmospheric turbulence and photon loss. A variety of studies have analyzed the SPDC brightness by decomposing biphoton states into LG modes, but they have often relied on a degenerate state, a narrow spectral bandwidth approximation, or a thin crystal approximation. However, these approaches are unsuitable for non-degenerate type-0 SPDC with a periodicallypoled nonlinear crystal, which offers higher brightness due to its superior nonlinear coefficients. In this study, we examine the spectrum of photon pairs in specific LG modes generated by a type-0 ppKTP crystal whileavoiding the constraints imposed by the aforementioned assumptions. In addition, we investigate the optimal focal parameters of the pump, signal, and idler to maximize the brightness for a given LG mode. Our findings show that it is not feasible to simultaneously optimize the brightness for different LG modes with a single pump focal parameter.

This letter proposes a Quantum SSL with entanglement augmentation method (QSEA). Different from existing Quantum SSLs, QSEA introduces an entanglement-based sample generation scheme and a fidelity-driven quantum loss function. Specifically, QSEA constructs augmented samples by entangling an auxiliary qubit with the raw state and applying parameterized unitary transformations. The loss function is defined using quantum fidelity, quantifying similarity between quantum representations and effectively capturing sample relations. Experimental results show that QSEA outperforms existing quantum self-supervised methods on multiple benchmarks and shows stronger stability in decorrelation noise environments.

Central to the model is a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - not as a statistical or epistemic limitation, but as a dynamical relation between kinetic energy transfer and wavefield contraction. This framework yields testable predictions about how weak, intermediate, and strong quantum interactions modulate spatial localization - predictions consistent with existing experimental findings. The upshot is a unified, falsifiable alternative to prevailing interpretations, and a foundation for a broader research program in wavefield interaction mechanics.",

This is achieved by interspersing the action of noise with quantum error correction in succession. We show this by means of a non-trivial lower bound on the one-shot quantum capacity in the sequential setting as a function of $n$, in an attempt to model a linear quantum network and assess its capabilities to distribute entanglement. Intriguingly, the rate of transmission of such a network turns out to be a property of the spectrum of the channels composed in sequence, and the maximum possible error in transmission can be bounded as a function of the noise model only. As an application, we derive an exact error bound for the infinite dimensional pure-loss channel believed to be the dominant source of noise in networks precluding the distribution of entanglement.

    "summary": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle, thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements. Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle, thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.   To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction. Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x with a circuit-level noise model.",

The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution.

Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.",

In particular we focus on two scenarios: On one hand, we provide bounds on the time that is needed for a control system to implement a given target unitary $U$ and on the other hand we bound the time that is needed to implement the dynamics of a target Hamiltonian $H$ in the worst case. We apply our abstract bounds on physically relevant systems like coupled qubits, spin chains, globally controlled Rydberg atoms and NMR molecules and compare our results to the existing literature. We hope that our bounds can aid experimentalists to identify bottlenecks and design faster quantum control systems.",

Operating near the thermodynamic noise limit with sub-eV energy resolution, TESs offer a powerful approach for probing light DM in the sub-GeV mass range. Optical TESs, realized on superconducting films with critical temperatures below 150 mK, achieve energy thresholds below 100 meV and enable precise calorimetric detection of individual energy depositions. We model TES response by incorporating fundamental noise sources and applying optimal filtering techniques, and evaluate their sensitivity across a range of DM interaction channels, accounting for in-medium effects in the target material. We show that even ng-month-scale exposures can reach previously unexplored DM-electron scattering cross sections below $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV masses, and can probe the MeV-scale mass range for DM-nucleon couplings. Combining high energy resolution, photon-number sensitivity, and scalability, optical TESs provide a compelling quantum sensing platform for rare-event searches at the intersection of particle physics and quantum metrology.",

The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.",

Focusing on the task of cooling a single qubit given access to $n$ separable, thermal qubits with arbitrary energy structure, we answer these questions by giving two new perspectives on this task. Firstly, we show that a set of inequalities related to the energetic structure of the $n$ qubit machine determines the optimal cooling protocol, which parts of the machine contribute to this protocol and gives rise to a Carnot-like bound. Secondly, we show that cooling protocols can be represented as perfect matchings on bipartite graphs enabling the optimization of cost functions e.g. gate complexity or dissipation. Our results generalize the algorithmic cooling problem, establish new fundamental bounds on quantum cooling and offer a framework for designing novel autonomous thermal machines and cooling algorithms.",

To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the \"hollowed\" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified.

We present three different compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues.

    "summary": "Quantum algorithms offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for a range of computational problems. The fundamental mechanisms underlying quantum computation required the development and construction of quantum computers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit count but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only gets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use of quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on utilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ devices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed for the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum device. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit partitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some focusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning, multi-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success in their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and noise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by minimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use dynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the benefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside quantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to noise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40% reduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of classical and quantum computation were required.",

Specifically, we propose a systematic relaxation that reduces the refined problem -- where full 1RDMs are fixed for certain ensemble elements -- to a more tractable form involving only natural occupation number vectors. Remarkably, we show that this relaxed problem is related to a generalization of Horn's problem, enabling an explicit solution by combining its constraints with those of the weighted ensemble $N$-representability conditions. An additional convex relaxation yields a convex polytope that provides physically meaningful restrictions on lattice site occupations in ensemble density functional theory for excited states.",

The final witness is chosen to self-test some target configuration.

However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the lifetime of an atom in the system.",

In this work, we investigate how individual two-body operators influence the global dynamics of circuits composed of dual-unitaries. We study their effect on entanglement generation while examining it from both bipartite and multipartite perspectives. Here we also highlight the significant role of local unitaries in the dynamics when paired with operators from the dual-unitary class, showing that systems with identical entangling power can exhibit a range of differing entanglement growth rates. Furthermore, we present calculations establishing time-step-dependent lower bounds, which depend on both the initial state and the entangling power of the constituent operators. Finally, we find that time-evolving an initial state composed of pair products generates a state with nearly maximal multipartite entanglement content, approaching the bounds established by Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states.",

However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.",

This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as the absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a dilute ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms with a low optical depth, and time-resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant laser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on establishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction is not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly susceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 $\\mu$K is enough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a theoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The model uses density-dependent dephasing rate of the long-range dipole-dipole correlations as a single adjustable parameter. Experiment-theory comparison indicates a dephasing coefficient of $\\beta/2 \\pi = 4.9 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hz~cm$^3$, which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the known dipole-dipole line broadening coefficient in $^{87}$Rb.",

An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space is intrinsically curved. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the curved Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems can be mapped to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems, and establish conditions when they become dual to each other, thus revealing a deeper geometric connection between the two. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and identifies the criteria under which quantum sensing in pseudo-Hermitian systems can exhibit supremacy over Hermitian ones.",

    "summary": "High-dimensional entangled states, such as spatially-entangled photon pairs produced by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), are a key resource for quantum technologies. In recent years, camera-based coincidence counting approaches have considerably improved the ability to characterize them in terms of speed and dimensionality. However, these methods have limitations, including in most of them the necessity to subtract accidental coincidences. Here, we study the role of these accidentals in entanglement certification for a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array and an intensified time-stamping (Tpx3Cam) camera. Using both Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and entropy-based criteria, we show that the level of accidental coincidences - determined by the temporal characteristics of the camera - and whether they are subtracted critically impact entanglement certification. In particular, we demonstrate that current single-photon camera technologies enable entanglement certification without accidental subtraction only if a Gaussian approximation is applied to the measured two-photon state. Our work is important for developing quantum-optics application in adversarial scenarios, such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD), and also for loophole-free experimental testing of quantum foundations.",

To mitigate intrinsic noise sources including spontaneous decay and motional effects, we develop a noise-aware optimal control framework that reduces gate errors under the presence of noise while maintaining smooth pulse profiles suitable for experimental implementation. In addition to equidistant qubit arrangements, we explore the impact of non-equidistant atomic configurations, where interaction inhomogeneity becomes significant. In these cases, the flexibility of our control approach helps to compensate for such variations, supporting reliable gate performance across different spatial layouts.

While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction.

    "summary": "Quantumness imposes a fundamental limit on measurement accuracy. The paradigmatic cases are Heisenberg's uncertainty relation in the original formulation, Robertson's formulation, and improved uncertainty relations. However, the more universal measures are given in terms of quantum entropies. Uncertainties of measurements done on one quantum system correlated with another quantum system constitute a more intriguing question. Quantum correlations can influence the lower bound of uncertainties, and the reason for this is the quantum memory. In this article, we study uncertainties of measurements performed on one quantum dot correlated with the second one through the superconductor, hosting the Majorana boundary modes. We prove that the Majorana quasiparticles allow the uncertainties to reach the minimal possible lower bound. By rigorous theoretical considerations, we obtain the result of experimental relevance expressed in terms of only two parameters: the overlap between Majorana modes and their coupling strength with the quantum dots. We show that the overlap between Majorana modes reduces quantum uncertainties, which is a general result of fundamental importance. We also propose the protocol to measure spins in both quantum dots, consecutively, and demonstrate that the result of the second measurement would depend on the presence of Majorana quasiparticles. This could serve as an indirect tool for their empirical observation, which is of importance for the ongoing discussions concerning unambiguous detection of the Majorana quasiparticles in nanoscopic hybrid structures.",

Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle robustness of LPM.

Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of experimental protocols limits the precision with which the environment can be measured and may obscure the detailed structure of these fluctuations. Here we present a real-time Bayesian method for estimating the relaxation rate of a qubit, leveraging a classical controller with an integrated field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Using our FPGA-powered Bayesian method, we adaptively and continuously track the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. Our technique allows for the estimation of these relaxation times in a few milliseconds, more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous nonadaptive methods, and allows us to observe fluctuations up to 5 times the qubit's average relaxation rates on significantly shorter timescales than previously reported. Our statistical analysis reveals that these fluctuations occur on much faster timescales than previously understood, with two-level-system switching rates reaching up to 10 Hz. Our work offers an appealing solution for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening and for improved understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.",

Our approach relies on two general-purpose algorithms that iteratively refine an initial outer-polytope approximation, guided by typical device behaviour and cryptographic intuition. These refinements strike a balance between computational tractability and approximation effectiveness. By integrating these approximations into the probability estimation (PE) framework [Zhang et al., PRA 2018], we obtain significantly improved certified entropy bounds in the finite-size regime. We test our method on various bipartite and tripartite DI-QRNG protocols, using both simulated and experimental data. In all cases, it yields notably higher entropy rates with fewer device uses than the existing techniques. We further extend our analysis to the more demanding task of randomness amplification, demonstrating major performance gains without added complexity.

Fuzzy inference, with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights, and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension, confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native fuzzy learning frameworks.",

As variational quantum circuits (VQCs) can be represented by Fourier series that contain an exponentially large spectrum in the number of input features, hope for quantum advantage remains. Nevertheless, properties of quantum Fourier models (QFMs) are not yet fully understood, in particular how they could potentially outperform classical alternatives. Viewing VQCs with Fourier lenses opens up possibilities to analyse which classes of functions can be tackled by variational algorithms such as QML, while also illuminating and quantifying remaining constraints and challenges. Considering that noise and imperfections remain dominant factors in the development trajectory from noisy intermediate-scale to fault-tolerant quantum computers, the aim of this work is to shed light on key properties of QFMs when exposed to noise. In particular, we systematically analyse the effect of noise on the Fourier spectrum, expressibility and entangling capability of QFMs by conducting large-scale numerical simulations of quantum systems. This may help to better utilise hardware resources, and guide the construction of tailored error correction schemes. We find that decoherent noise exerts a uniform deleterious effect on all the tested ans\\\"atze, manifesting in the vanishing of Fourier coefficients, expressibility and entangling capability. We note however, that the detrimental influence of noise is less pronounced in some ans\\\"atze than in others, suggesting that these might possess greater resilience to noise.",

Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of expectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse - highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse fidelities.",

We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for characterizing energy-constrained quantum multi-step processes, which can be applied to other tasks of quantum information processing beyond metrology. Based on the framework, we develop a general optimization method for energy-constrained quantum metrology that determines the optimal precision as well as the corresponding optimal strategy. Applying our method to phase estimation, we show that while the estimation precision can benefit arbitrarily from increasing dimension with unconstrained energy, energy constraints result in an ultimate precision scaling of $1/E^2$ in an infinite-dimensional system, where $E$ is the available energy, which reveals that limited energy could be an essential barrier to precision improvement.",

    "summary": "Nonlocality exhibited by ensembles of composite quantum states, wherein local operations and classical communication (LOCC) yield suboptimal discrimination probabilities compared to global strategies, is one of the striking nonclassical features of quantum theory. A variant of this phenomenon arises in conclusive local state discrimination, where the correct state must be identified with zero error, albeit allowing for inconclusive outcomes. More recently, the notion of local state marking has been introduced with the focus shifted to correctly identifying permutation of a subset of states random chosen from a given set of multipartite states under LOCC. In this work, we unify these two approaches by introducing the task of conclusive local state marking, which reveals a finer hierarchy of nonlocality in multipartite quantum state ensembles. Notably, we demonstrate that certain ensembles of product states can exhibit a stronger form of nonlocality than entangled ensembles traditionally considered highly nonlocal.",

This detuning induces three related quantities-a synthetic magnetic field, an angular velocity, and an angular momentum-which, due to trap anisotropy, may point in different directions. When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or bi-conical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.",

This paper presents QARMA, a novel Qubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for Modular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that incorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an attention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal qubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core communications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based encoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit interactions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages mid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and qubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to highly-optimized Qiskit with modular architecture configuration, QARMA-R reduces inter-core communications by up to 100% (on average 85%), while QARMA maintains 15-40% improvement for larger circuits without reuse. Against traditional modular qubit mapping, our approach achieves 96.4-100% reduction in inter-core operation.

Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques.

The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation.

Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs.

However, this quantum-classical separation is known to \\emph{not} persist when the SYK model is sufficiently sparsified, i.e., when terms in the model are discarded with probability $1-p$, where $p=\\Theta(1/n^3)$ and $n$ is the system size. This raises the question of how robust the quantum and classical complexities of the SYK model are to sparsification.   In this work we initiate the study of the sparse SYK model where $p \\in [\\Theta(1/n^3),1]$. We show there indeed exists a certain robustness of sparsification. First, we prove that the quantum algorithm of Hastings--O'Donnell for $p=1$ still achieves a constant-factor approximation to the ground energy when $p\\geq\\Omega(\\log n/n)$. Additionally, we prove that with high probability, Gaussian states cannot achieve better than a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n/pn})$-factor approximation to the true ground state energy of sparse SYK.

Stabilizer codes, and in particular topological surface codes, are promising candidates for implementing QEC by redundantly encoding quantum information. While it is widely believed that a strictly fault-tolerant protocol can only be implemented using single- and two-qubit gates, several quantum computing platforms, based on trapped ions, neutral atoms and also superconducting qubits support native multi-qubit operations, e.g. using multi-ion entangling gates, Rydberg blockade or parallelized tunable couplers, respectively. In this work, we show that stabilizer measurement circuits for unrotated surface codes can be fault-tolerant using single auxiliary qubits and three-qubit gates. These gates enable lower-depth circuits leading to fewer fault locations and potentially shorter QEC cycle times. Concretely, we find that in an optimistic parameter regime where fidelities of three-qubit gates are the same as those of two-qubit gates, the logical error rate can be up to one order of magnitude lower and the threshold can be significantly higher, increasing from $\\approx 0.76 \\%$ to $\\approx 1.05 \\%$.

Here we design a 3-qubit CZZ gate for superconducting transmon qubits that maps the parity of two data qubits onto one measurement qubit in a single step. We find that the gate can be executed in a duration of $35\\,$ns with a fidelity of F$=99.96 \\, \\%$. To optimize the gate, we use an error model obtained from the microscopic gate simulation to systematically suppress Pauli errors that are particularly harmful to the QEC protocol. Using this error model, we investigate the implementation of this 3-qubit gate in a surface code syndrome readout schedule. We find that for the rotated surface code, the implementation of CZZ gates increases the error threshold by nearly 50\\% to $\\approx 1.2\\,\\%$ and decreases the logical error rate, in the experimental relevant regime, by up to one order of magnitude, compared to the standard CZ readout protocol. We also show that for the unrotated surface code, strictly fault-tolerant readout schedules can be found. This opens a new perspective for below-threshold surface-code error correction, where it can be advantageous to use multi-qubit gates instead of two-qubit gates to obtain a better QEC performance.",

Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2{\\pi} periodic.

    "summary": "We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.",

    "summary": "We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.",

Anyons, as quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems, exhibit unique entanglement properties that differ from the conventional quantum systems, resulting from the absence of a tensor product structure in their state spaces. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between Bell nonlocality and entanglement in anyonic states. Specifically, we find that certain pure anyonic states with non-zero anyonic entanglement entropy (AEE) are local, yet exhibit nonlocality when subjected to collective measurements on multiple copies-a phenomenon known as superactivation of nonlocality, which is typically observed in conventional mixed states. To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement of anyonic states into two components: one from the tensor product structure and the other representing residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic behavior, we find that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE while the latter diminishes with the number of copies. Crucially, the entanglement component associated with the tensor product structure demonstrates a significant correlation with nonlocality, which explains the observed superactivation of nonlocality. Our findings provide new insights into the connection between entanglement and nonlocality in anyonic systems.",

Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel, realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems.

Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.",

In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale.

We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold.

This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect - power narrowing - takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed.   While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.",

Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size. Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate, through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition, we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states, which closely match recent experimental observations that the quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking quantum devices to photoisomerization.",

    "summary": "We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\\\"atze.",

    "summary": "High-fidelity multi-qubit initialization is vital for quantum simulation, quantum information processing (QIP), and quantum sensing. In diamond platforms, nuclear spin registers can be initialized through polarization transfer from a nearby electronic spin whose high gyromagnetic ratio enables efficient dynamical nuclear polarization (DNP). These hybrid systems are typically controlled using diabatic spin rotations, which require precise knowledge of all system parameters. Adiabatic DNP protocols on the other hand have less strict requirements and could enable robust and high fidelity spin transfer. However, due to the slow adiabatic sweeps and limited electron spin coherence times, this approach has remained inaccessible. Here, we demonstrate adiabatic pulsed nuclear spin polarization at room temperature in diamond. We achieve enhanced polarization efficiency, a broad resonance window, and improved tolerance to hyperfine coupling uncertainties relative to conventional diabatic pulsed protocols. We also show how this approach can benefit the initialization of spin clusters. These results set the scene for enhanced qubit initialization in solid state through adiabatic pulsed driving, with applications in solid-state quantum sensor and quantum memory technologies.",

    "summary": "When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a beam splitter (BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output. Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore, through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving quantum noise control.",

In this work, we introduce a unified topological invariant applicable across both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes. In the weak nonlinearity regime, where the nonlinear bands are wellseparated, the invariant reduces to the Abelian Chern number of the occupied nonlinear band. Consequently, the pumped charge is quantized to an integer value. As the nonlinearity increases, the nonlinear bands start to intertwine, leading to a situation where the invariant is expressed as the non-Abelian Chern number divided by the number of interacting bands. This could result in a fractional quantization of the pumped charge. Our unified topological invariant approach not only advances the understanding of the soliton dynamics, but also provides implications for the future design of nonlinear topological systems.",

If scattering events, mediated by a bath, between those quasiparticles can be approximated as density-density interactions, the bath behaves like an effective external potential. On the other hand, exchange interactions could entangle those quasiparticles and the bath, leading to an open quantum system that induces quantum decoherence and spectral broadening. We investigate the renormalized interaction between the SOI and the bath, employing a projection operator technique similar to the one used in the Nakajima-Zwanzig method. We find that the frequency variation of this renormalized interaction is analogous to the quasiparticle residue and provides a measure of the SOI-bath separability that serves as the lower bound of the SOI-bath entanglement entropy. In the weak-coupling regime and continuum limit, we demonstrate that the degree of SOI-bath separability corresponds to the quasiparticle spectral weight in the single-impurity Anderson model and find that the loss of quantum information to the continuum of the bath can be understood as a decay process where an initial single-impurity state escapes to a thermal bath. This work provides a direction for connecting energy dissipation in quasiparticles propagation to the loss of quantum information in open quantum systems.",

The range of incident momentum that can facilitate the generation of second-order RWs under different interspecies interaction strengths is determined, and machine learning is employed to find and analyze relationships among the interspecies interaction, the incident momentum, and the offset that can lead to the generation of second-order RWs.

As such, one might consider such phase space approaches ad hoc. To that end, here we show how to formally extract exact quantum energies from a coupled nuclear-electronic Hamiltonian using perturbation theory on top of a phase space electronic framework.

Usually, these resource estimates are based upon the assumption that quantum error correction is implemented using the surface code, and that the best surface code compilation scheme involves serializing input circuits by eliminating all Clifford gates. This transformation is thought to make best use of the native multi-body measurement (lattice surgery) instruction set available to surface codes. Some work, however, has suggested that direct compilation from Clifford+T to lattice surgery operations may be beneficial for circuits that have high degrees of logical parallelism. In this study, we analyze the resource costs for implementing Hamiltonian simulation using example approaches from each of these leading surface code compilation families. The Hamiltonians whose dynamics we consider are those of the transverse-field Ising model in several geometries, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the $\\mathrm{\\alpha-RuCl_3}$ complex under a time-varying magnetic field. We show, among other things, that the optimal scheme depends on whether Hamiltonian simulation is implemented using the quantum signal processing or Trotter-Suzuki algorithms, with Trotterization benefiting by orders of magnitude from direct Clifford+T compilation for these applications.

The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schr\\\"odinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.",

    "summary": "Exploring strongly correlated spinful states of few fermionic ultracold atoms in a rapidly rotating trap, an example of which was recently realized for two fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an optical tweezer, we derive analytical (algebraic) total-spin-eigenstate wavefunctions through the development and employment of a theoretical platform that integrates exact numerical diagonalization (full configuration interaction, FCI) with symbolic language processing. For such rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wavefunctions (for two and three spinful $^6$Li atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI results, and they are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability of previous Jastrow-type treatments. These results, and their extension to bosonic systems, provide the impetus and analysis tools for future experimental and theoretical simulations of larger mesoscopic systems",

Open source simulators for quantum circuits already exist, but a deeper understanding is gained by writing ones own. With roughly 1000-2000 lines of code, one can simulate Hadamard, Pauli X, Y, Z, SWAP, and other quantum logic gates, with arbitrary combinations of control and anticontrol qubits, on circuits of up to 20+ qubits, with no special libraries, on a personal computer. We explain key algorithms for a simulator, in particular: qubit-wise multiplication for updating the state vector, and partial trace for finding a reduced density matrix. We also discuss optimizations, and how to compute qubit phase, purity, and other statistics. A complete example implementation in JavaScript is available at https://github.com/MJMcGuffin/muqcs.js , which also demonstrates how to compute von Neumann entropy, concurrence (to quantify entanglement), and magic, while remaining much smaller and easier to study than other popular software packages.",

    "summary": "Two-level systems (TLS) are known to be a dominant source of dissipation and decoherence in superconducting qubits. Superconducting resonators provide a convenient way to study TLS-induced loss due to easier design and fabrication in comparison to devices that include non-linear elements. However, accurately measuring TLS-induced loss in a resonator in the quantum regime is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal fluctuations of the TLS, leading to uncertainties of 30% or more. To address these limitations, we develop a multi-wave resonator device that extends the resonator length from a standard quarter-wave $\\lambda/4$ to $N\\lambda/4$ where $N = 37$ at 6GHz. This design provides two key advantages: the TLS-induced fluctuations are reduced by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$ due to spatial averaging over an increased number of independent TLS, and the measurement SNR for a given intra-resonator energy density improves by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$. The multi-wave resonator also has fundamental and harmonic resonances that allow one to study the frequency dependence of TLS-induced loss. In this work we fabricate both multi-wave and quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators formed from thin-film aluminum on a silicon substrate, and characterize their TLS properties at both 10mK and 200mK. Our results show that the power-dependent TLS-induced loss measured from both types of resonators agree well, with the multi-wave resonators achieving a five-fold reduction in measurement uncertainty due to TLS fluctuations, down to 5%. The $N\\lambda/4$ resonator also provides a measure of the fully unsaturated TLS-induced loss due to the improved measurement SNR at low intra-resonator energy densities. Finally, measurements across seven harmonic resonances of the $N\\lambda/4$ resonator between 4GHz - 6.5GHz reveals no frequency dependence in the TLS-induced loss over this range.",

While network nonlocality has been well studied in discrete-variable (DV) systems, its exploration in continuous-variable (CV) systems remains limited. In this work, we study the bilocal scenario, the simplest quantum network, in a CV framework using pseudospin measurements. We show that two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states violate the bilocality inequality for any nonzero squeezing, with the violation increasing monotonically and reaching the maximum in the infinite squeezing limit. The robustness of this violation is explored in the presence of local thermal noise. Next, we demonstrate nonbilocality in two key non-Gaussian states, viz., the entangled coherent state and the CV Werner state. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of nonbilocal correlations through photon subtraction applied to the TMSV state. We show that a coherent superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes enables maximal bilocality violation even at zero squeezing, demonstrating non-Gaussianity as a strong resource in the low-squeezing regime. Our findings underscore the potential of CV systems for realizing network-based quantum correlations.",

While the two pictures are equivalent at the level of physical predictions, we show that the divisibility properties of the corresponding dual maps are, in general, not equivalent. This inequivalence originates from the distinction between left and right generators of time-local master equations, which interchange roles under duality. We demonstrate that Schr\\\"odinger and Heisenberg divisibility are distinct concepts by constructing explicit dynamics divisible only in one picture. Furthermore, we introduce a quantifier for the violation of Heisenberg P-divisibility, analogous to the trace-distance-based measure of non-Markovianity, and provide it with an operational interpretation in terms of the guessing probability between effects. Our results show that Heisenberg divisibility is an independent witness of memory effects and highlight the need to consider both pictures when characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics.",

In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the N\\'eel vector.

    "title": "On whether quantum theory needs complex numbers: the foil theories perspective",
    "summary": "Recent work by Renou et al. (2021) has led to some controversy concerning the question of whether quantum theory requires complex numbers for its formulation. We promote the view that the main result of that work is best understood not as a claim about the relative merits of different representations of quantum theory, but rather as a claim about the possibility of experimentally adjudicating between standard quantum theory and an alternative theory -- a foil theory -- known as real-amplitude quantum theory (RQT). In particular, the claim is that this adjudication can be achieved given only an assumption about the causal structure of the experiment. Here, we aim to shed some light on why this is possible, by reconceptualizing the comparison of the two theories as an instance of a broader class of such theory comparisons. By recasting RQT as the subtheory of quantum theory that arises by symmetrizing with respect to the collective action of a time-reversal symmetry, we can compare it to other subtheories that arise by symmetrization, but for different symmetries. If the symmetry has a unitary representation, the resulting foil theory is termed a twirled quantum world, and if it does not (as is the case in RQT), the resulting foil theory is termed a swirled quantum world. We show that, in contrast to RQT, there is no possibility of distinguishing any twirled quantum world from quantum theory given only an assumption about causal structure. We also define analogues of twirling and swirling for an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and identify certain necessary conditions on a causal structure for it to be able to support a causal compatibility gap between the theory and its symmetrized version. We draw out the implications of these analyses for the question of how a lack of a shared reference frame state features into the possibility of such a gap.",

    "summary": "Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\\nu = 2/(4p \\mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \\pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.",

We propose to study the dimension of a quantum state's orbit (as a manifold in the Hilbert space), a simple yet nontrivial topological property that can quantify \"how many\" states it can reach. As natural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone can reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary transformations deterministically. We showcase a general and straightforward way to compute orbit dimensions for states of finite support in the Fock basis, by leveraging the group's Lie algebra. We also study genericity and robustness properties of orbit dimensions, and propose approaches to efficiently evaluate them experimentally. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the Gaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be universal for multimode pure states. While proven in the discrete variable setting (i.e. passive linear optics with an energy cutoff), the validity of our work in the continuous variable setting does rest on a technical conjecture which we do not prove.",

At the same time, it is crucial to use a low photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with biological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the first time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable.

Although only partially relational -- the absolute structures of simultaneity and Euclidean geometry are still retained -- these models provide a useful testing ground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic relativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have definite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the quantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework. Here, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive states that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures of the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational and we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational with respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the longstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory take after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are to be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these developments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a generally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue of what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.",

    "summary": "The principle of tomographic locality states that the operational state of a multipartite system can be fully characterized by the statistics obtained from measurements that are local to the individual subsystems. This property holds in quantum theory and features prominently in axiomatic reconstructions of the theory, where it serves to rule out a wide class of alternatives. For instance, quantum theory with Hilbert spaces defined over the real field (rather than the complex field) is an example of a theory that is ruled out in this fashion. Given its foundational importance, it is worthwhile to subject this principle to a direct experimental test. Specifically, we consider an experiment on the polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of photonic modes in a prepare-and-measure scenario and analyze the resulting data within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. The signature of a failure of tomographic locality is that there are pairs of states on the bipartite system that can only be distinguished by the statistics they yield for non-separable measurements. In the full quantum setting, we find no evidence of a violation of tomographic locality. As a test of our analysis method, we also verify that if we restrict attention to those states and measurements that lie within the fragment described by quantum theory over the real field, then a clear signature of the failure of tomographic locality is observed.",

Although various topological transfer protocols based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or its variants have been proposed, the phase accumulation during the evolution, as an essential aspect, is underestimated. Here, by numerically studying the phase information of quantum state transfer (QST) in one-dimensional (1D) topological spin chains, we uncover a universal phase correction $\\phi_0 =(N-1)\\pi/2$ for both adiabatic and diabatic topological schemes. Interestingly, the site-number-dependent phase correction satisfies $\\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ symmetry and is equally effective for perfect mirror transmission in spin chains. Our work reveals a universal phase correction in 1D topologically protected QST, which will prompt a reevaluation of the topological protection mechanism in quantum systems.",

As a proof of principle, we recover the complete set of facet inequalities for some non-trivial scenarios involving two senders and a receiver with no input. Explicit quantum protocols are studied that violate these inequalities, demonstrating quantum advantage. We further investigate the task of anti-distinguishing the joint input string held by the senders and derive upper bounds on the optimal classical success probability.

Here we investigate this relationship using the example of an interacting NH spin system defined on random graphs. We show that the onset of the first exceptional point - marking the real-to-complex spectral transition - also corresponds to an abrupt change in the system's learning capacity. We further demonstrate that this transition is controllable via local disorder and spin interactions strength, thereby defining a tunable learnability threshold. Within the learning phase, the system exhibits the key features required for memory-dependent reservoir computing. This makes explicit a direct link between spectral structure and computational capacity, further establishing non-Hermiticity, and more broadly engineered dissipation, as a dynamic resource for temporal quantum machine learning.",

In the context of near-term quantum metrology, quantum error mitigation offers a promising strategy to leverage quantum resources. While existing error-mitigated protocols largely depend on virtual state purification, significant noise accumulation and the additional noise introduced by the noisy implementations of these protocols can impede the effectiveness. To address these problems, we propose probabilistic virtual channel purification to handle the largely accumulated noise while efficiently canceling additional noise from itself. This also naturally leads to an enhanced version of virtual state purification, namely probabilistic virtual state purification. Within the sequential scheme of quantum metrology, our error analysis reveals a significant reduction in bias and a quantum advantage in sampling cost when the number of channels encoding the interested parameters is $O(p^{-1})$, where $p$ is the error rate of the encoding channel. In this range, both probabilistic virtual purification methods demonstrate significant improvements in parameter estimation precision and robustness against practical noise, as evidenced by numerical simulations for both single- and multi-parameter tasks.",

Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy.

If the problem has no constraints or only one constraint, such as functional dependencies or degree constraints, tight worst-case size bounds have been proven, and they are even practically computable. If the problem has more than one constraint, computing tight bounds can be difficult in practice and may even require an infinite number of linear inequalities in its optimization formulation. While these challenges have been addressed with varying methods, no prior research has employed quantum information theory to address this problem. In this work, we establish a connection between earlier work on estimating size bounds for conjunctive queries with classical information theory and the field of quantum information theory. We propose replacing the classical Shannon entropy formulation with the quantum R\\'enyi entropy. Whereas classical Shannon entropy requires infinitely many inequalities to characterize the optimization space, R\\'enyi entropy requires only one type of inequality, which is non-negativity. Although this is a promising modification, optimization with respect to the quantum states instead of classical distributions creates a new set of challenges that prevent us from finding a practically computable, tight worst-case size bound. In this line, we propose a quantum version to derive worst-case size bounds. The previous tight classical worst-case size bound can be viewed as a special limit of this quantum bound.

    "summary": "We establish a direct connection between spread complexity and quantum circuit complexity by demonstrating that spread complexity emerges as a limiting case of a circuit complexity framework built from two fundamental operations: time-evolution and superposition. Our approach leverages a computational setup where unitary gates and beam-splitting operations generate target states, with the minimal cost of synthesis yielding a complexity measure that converges to spread complexity in the infinitesimal time-evolution limit. This perspective not only provides a physical interpretation of spread complexity but also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods like the Lanczos algorithm fail. We illustrate our framework with an explicit SU(2) example and discuss broader applications, including cases where return amplitudes are non-perturbative or divergent",

Here, we demonstrate new qubit variants of this problem that are complete for $\\mathsf{BQP_1}$, $\\mathsf{coRP}$, $\\mathsf{QCMA}$, $\\mathsf{PI(coRP,NP)}$, $\\mathsf{PI(BQP_1,NP)}$, $\\mathsf{PI(BQP_1,MA)}$, $\\mathsf{SoPU(coRP,NP)}$, $\\mathsf{SoPU(BQP_1,NP)}$, and $\\mathsf{SoPU(BQP_1,MA)}$. Our result implies that a complete classification of quantum constraint satisfaction problems (QCSPs), analogous to Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for classical CSPs, must either include these 13 classes, or otherwise show that some are equal. Additionally, our result showcases two new types of QSAT problems that can be decided efficiently, as well as the first nontrivial $\\mathsf{BQP_1}$-complete problem. We first prove there are qudit QSAT problems that are complete for $\\mathsf{BQP_1}$, $\\mathsf{coRP}$, and $\\mathsf{QCMA}$ by re-defining elements of the circuit-to-Hamiltonian transformation. We then show that any QCSP can be reduced to a problem in qubits while maintaining the same complexity - something believed not to be possible classically. The remaining six problems are obtained by considering \"sums\" and \"products\" of the first seven QSAT problems. Before this work, the QSAT problems generated in this way resulted in complete problems for $\\mathsf{PI}$ and $\\mathsf{SoPU}$ classes that were trivially equal to other known classes. We thus commence the study of these new and seemingly nontrivial classes. While [Meiburg, 2021] first sought to prove completeness for the first three classes, we note that his constructions are flawed.

Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave sates. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be readily applied to a broad range of physical systems.",

    "summary": "In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, emerging classical-quantum hybrid optimization algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), can leverage the unique characteristics of quantum devices to accelerate computations tailored to specific problems with shallow circuits. However, these algorithms encounter biases and iteration difficulties due to significant noise in quantum processors. These difficulties can only be partially addressed without error correction by optimizing hardware, reducing circuit complexity, or fitting and extrapolation. A compelling solution is applying probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a quantum error mitigation technique that enables unbiased results without full error correction. Traditional PEC is challenging to apply in VQAs due to its variance amplification, contradicting iterative process assumptions. This paper proposes a novel noise-adaptable strategy that combines PEC with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It is implemented through invariant sampling circuits (invariant-PEC, or IPEC) and substantially reduces iteration variance. This strategy marks the first successful integration of PEC and QAOA, resulting in efficient convergence. Moreover, we introduce adaptive partial PEC (APPEC), which modulates the error cancellation proportion of IPEC during iteration. We experimentally validated this technique on a superconducting quantum processor, cutting sampling cost by 90.1\\%. Notably, we find that dynamic adjustments of error levels via APPEC can enhance escape from local minima and reduce sampling costs. These results open promising avenues for executing VQAs with large-scale, low-noise quantum circuits, paving the way for practical quantum computing advancements.",

To establish this approach, we develop a photonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) platform based on etchless polymer waveguides, which substantially suppress parasitic scattering at detector terminations while ensuring compatibility with standard photonic substrates and cryogenic operation. We show BIC-coupled inline detectors with on-chip efficiency exceeding 80%, recovery time of less than 2 ns, and intrinsic jitter of less than 70 ps. As a proof of principle, we implement a Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometer with footprint of 60x6 um2, and a photon number resolving detector for discrimination of collinear photon pairs. The demonstration of accurate and reliable inline quantum measurements within a simple and scalable photonic architecture offers a viable pathway to realize more complex quantum circuit functionalities, such as higher-order correlation measurements, quantum state tomography, and multi-photon subtraction.",

    "summary": "The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the electromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the vector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect that it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This motivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential, which inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation is shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which support the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient mathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness, the vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely explains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a property such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any regular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss the role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector potential.",

Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.",

    "summary": "Quantum transduction converts quantum states between different frequencies. Similarly, quantum teleportation transfers quantum states between different systems. While often appreciated for quantum communication between distant locations, teleportation can also operate between different frequencies. In terms of bosonic modes, quantum teleportation relies on two-mode squeezing -- squeezed on the balanced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quadratures -- for entanglement and a balanced beamsplitter plus homodyne detection for Bell measurement. Since cross-frequency band entanglement is challenging to generate, we propose to enable transduction with teleportation, while only relying on a conventional transduction device and narrow-band entanglement. Our insight is that a transduction device performs a cross-frequency-band beamsplitter, almost what is needed in a Bell measurement, except that it is often not balanced. We resolve the issue by proposing a generalized teleportation protocol with arbitrarily unbalanced EPR quadratures and matched unbalanced beamsplitters. The protocol can enhance quantum transduction, using only off-the-shelf components -- intraband beamsplitters, offline squeezing, homodyne detection and displacements. The proposed protocol achieves perfect transduction when applying to a transduction device with an arbitrarily low efficiency, at infinite squeezing. A minimum squeezing in the range of [1.195,4.343] decibels is needed to achieve quantum capacity enhancement.",

In this model, gate error rates and structural dependencies inform the weights of nodes (gates) and hyperedges (representing multi-qubit interactions and qubit timelines), guiding an Mt-KaHyPar partitioner to minimize cuts through error-prone operations.

    "summary": "Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or CX depth of the mapped circuits.   We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.   We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after (CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However, taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise reduction.",

The optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. We prove these inequalities in the cases of state ensembles corresponding to acute or flat pyramids, thus providing the proof of the hypothesis concerning the globally information-optimal observable.",

Classical machine learning methods offer certain advantages in addressing these difficulties. In this work, we propose a novel framework that bypasses the need to measure physical observables by directly learning the parameters of parameterized quantum circuits. By integrating the attention mechanism from large language models (LLMs) with a variational autoencoder (VAE), we efficiently capture hidden correlations within the circuit parameters. These correlations allow us to extract information about quantum phase transitions in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, our VAE acts as a classical representation of parameterized quantum circuits and the corresponding many-body quantum states, enabling the efficient generation of quantum states associated with specific phases. We apply our framework to a variety of quantum systems and demonstrate its broad applicability, with particularly strong performance in identifying topological quantum phase transitions.",

Along this, perfect state transfer (PST) and fractional state transfer (FST) have emerged as promising schemes for quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation using only nearest-neighbor couplings. However, the current implementations suffer from quantum loss and limited parameter tunability. In this work, we propose a new quantum state transfer scheme based on a zig-zag configuration, which introduces a controlling parameter for PST and FST. We show that this new parameter can suppress the population in the intermediate qubits, thereby reducing losses. We experimentally demonstrate the dynamics of different configurations on a superconducting quantum processor, achieving an $18\\%$ reduction in error for remote Bell state generation in a 1D ($1\\times5$) qubit chain, and exhibit robustness against certain types of noise. Then we extend our approach to a 2D network, successfully generating a W state among the four corner qubits.

The optical states are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available. Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions.

Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force.

One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.",

We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable.

By encoding bulk information into highly entangled boundary degrees of freedom, they capture key features of holography such as subregion duality, operator reconstruction, and complementary recovery. Among them, hyperinvariant tensor networks-characterized by the inclusion of edge tensors and the enforcement of multi-tensor isometries-offer a promising platform for realizing features such as state dependence and nontrivial boundary correlations. However, existing constructions are largely confined to two-dimensional regular tilings, and the structural principles underlying hyperinvariance remain poorly understood, especially in higher dimensions. To address this, we introduce a geometric criterion called angular k-uniformity, which refines standard k-uniformity and its planar variants by requiring isometric behavior within angular sectors of a tensor's rotationally symmetric layout. This condition enables the systematic identification and construction of hyperinvariant holographic codes on regular hyperbolic honeycombs in arbitrary dimension, and extends naturally to heterogeneous networks and qLEGO architectures beyond regular tilings. Altogether, angular k-uniformity provides a versatile, geometry-aware framework for analyzing and designing holographic tensor networks and codes with hyperinvariant features such as nontrivial boundary correlations and state-dependent complementary recovery.",

We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form.

In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features.

An operation of the circuits is based on classical evolution and interference of complex amplitudes associated with each CBS. The framework can emulate entangled states and is free from decoherence, measurements are classical and do not collapse states. Similar to physical quantum computers, emulated quantum algorithms can be constructed as a sequence of the gates belonging to a universal set (phase shift, Hadamard, controlled-NOT), as a unitary matrix and as combinations of the two. Circuits representing the universal gates have been made and tested. We also have made a matrix-based emulator of a 3-qubit Grover search algorithm. We tested it by searching for one and two particular states with one and two iterations and found that its outputs accurately match predicted values.

Our protocol employs the minimum-error state discrimination approach. For demonstrating the retention of entanglement in the ensemble states at each step, we use logarithmic negativity as well as the concept of entanglement witnessing. For a large family of sets of the two states, the success probability of discrimination can be as close as required to unity, while sustaining a finite amount of entanglement in each step.",

    "summary": "A compelling application of quantum computers with thousands of qubits is quantum simulation. Simulating fermionic systems is both a problem with clear real-world applications and a computationally challenging task. In order to simulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, one has to first map the fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian. The most popular such mapping is the Jordan-Wigner encoding, which suffers from inefficiencies caused by the high weight of some encoded operators. As a result, alternative local encodings have been proposed that solve this problem at the expense of a constant factor increase in the number of qubits required. Some such encodings possess local stabilizers, i.e., Pauli operators that act as the logical identity on the encoded fermionic modes. A natural error mitigation approach in these cases is to measure the stabilizers and discard any run where a measurement returns a -1 outcome. Using a high-performance stabilizer simulator, we classically simulate the performance of a local encoding known as the Derby-Klassen encoding and compare its performance with the Jordan-Wigner encoding and the ternary tree encoding. Our simulations use more complex error models and significantly larger system sizes (up to $18\\times18$) than in previous work. We find that the high sampling requirements of postselection methods with the Derby-Klassen encoding pose a limitation to its applicability in near-term devices and call for more encoding-specific circuit optimizations.",

    "title": "Metainformation in Quantum Guessing Games",
    "summary": "Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum information processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and extracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the influence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement strategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the guessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side information, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the success probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction by introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information about information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side information of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet provided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no expectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have operational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that metainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success probability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as useful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no benefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side information, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing, information, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of quantum systems in information processing tasks.",

    "summary": "We investigate localization transitions in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in tilted optical lattices, focusing on both the continuum limit accessed via shallow lattice depths and the tight-binding limit realized in the deep lattice regime. Utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the many-body Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze the scaling behavior of localization indicators, such as the root mean square width and fidelity susceptibility, as a function of the applied tilt. Our results reveal clear signatures of a localization-delocalization transition driven by the linear potential, with scaling properties that characterize criticality even in the presence of interactions within the GPE description. Despite the single-mode nature of the condensate wavefunction, we demonstrate that it can effectively probe quantum criticality. Building on this, we propose the use of interacting BECs in tilted lattices as a platform for quantum critical sensing, where the condensate wavefunction serves both as a sensitive probe of localization and a practical resource for quantum-enhanced metrology. This approach opens new avenues for precision gradient sensing based on localization phenomena in bosonic systems.",

However, the polarization of the condensate has not been fully understood and measured in this weakly driven-dissipative system. In this letter, we experimentally investigate the polarization of thermal and condensed light depending on the power and polarization of the pump beam. With full control over the polarization of the pump, it is possible to create arbitrary states on the surface of the Poincar\\'e sphere. We show that, in agreement with previous theoretical work, there is a remarkable increase in the polarization strength of the condensate above the threshold for a fully linearly polarized pump. Above a certain threshold also the degenerate orthogonal polarized state of the cavity is occupied, limiting the degree of polarization to approximately 90%.",

Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory.

Using a mean-field framework, we model the ensemble as an effective spin communication channel and develop a cascaded quantum model to describe both absorption and emission processes. We derive optimal time-dependent modulations of the cavity linewidth that maximize storage and retrieval efficiency for finite-duration wavepackets. Our analysis yields an upper bound on efficiency, which can be met in the narrow bandwidth regime. It also shows the existence of a critical bandwidth above which the efficiency severely decreases.

We investigate strategies for distributing quantum entanglement between two distant parties through noisy quantum channels. Specifically, we compare two configurations: one where the entanglement source is placed at the midpoint of the communication line, and another where it is located at one end. For certain families of qubit channels we show analytically that the midpoint strategy is optimal. Based on extensive numerical analysis, we conjecture that this strategy is generally optimal for all qubit channels. Focusing on the midpoint configuration, we develop semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques to assess whether entanglement can be successfully distributed through the network, and to quantify the amount of entanglement that can be distributed in the process. In many relevant cases the SDP formulation reliably captures the maximal amount of entanglement which can be distributed, if entanglement is quantified using the negativity. We analyze several channel models and demonstrate that, for various combinations of amplitude damping and depolarizing noise, entanglement distribution is only possible with weakly entangled input states. Excessive entanglement in the input state can hinder the channel's ability to establish entanglement. Our findings have implications for optimizing entanglement distribution in realistic quantum communication networks.",

Employing concrete examples of nickel oxide and hematite, we find strong squeezing of the magnon pseudospin highlighting its important role in determining the eigenmode quantum properties. Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin squeezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic modes and other excitations.

This holds for naive, projected, self-consistent, and state-transfer parametrizations of the LR operators. With a focus on the state-transfer parameterization, this problem is shown to also hold for more complicated systems, and is also present when the LR is truncated to singles and doubles. This problem can be alleviated by performing a ground-state constrained trace optimization of the Hessian matrix before performing the LR calculation.

Here we open a new door by demonstrating exciton-polariton condensation in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr, a van der Waals material with strongly intertwined optical and magnetic properties. Under photoexcitation, CrSBr microwires embedded in an optical cavity show the hallmarks of polariton condensation: a dramatic increase of the emission intensity from an excited laterally confined polariton state by multiple orders of magnitude, spectral narrowing of the emission line, and an intriguing continuous shift of the peak energy. Interferometry evidences an increase of spatial and temporal coherence. The conditions for efficient optical pumping suggest a crucial role of surface excitons and ultrafast polariton-magnon scattering.

Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.",

Operating in finite time, the engine attains finite power, which is enhanced through quantum correlations, specifically correlation between spin pairs and projective measurements on the ancillary pair. The system consists of dual qubit pairs, where one pair serves as the working medium and the other as an ancillary system facilitating measurement-induced heat exchange.

Determining the physical nature of wavefunctions remains an open problem that is at the very core of quantum mechanics, About a decade ago, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolf (PBR) claimed to prove an ontologically real status of wavefunctions by ruling out $\\psi$-epistemic models. The result was obtained by associating wavefunctions to hypothetical distributions of notional physical states, and by examining whether some physical states were associated with more than one wavefunction, a criterion they chose for defining a wavefunction as `epistemic'. I show that the starting assumption in the PBR argument, of associating a wavefunction with a distribution of physical states, is flawed and contradictory to the linear structure of quantum mechanics coupled with its quadratic Born's rule. Since none of the axioms or calculations of observable statistical results in the standard quantum theory depends on specifying the physical nature of a $\\psi$-function, the considerations in the PBR paper, involving a standard process of the preparation and projective measurements of quantum states, cannot address the ontological status of the wavefunctions in space and time.",

    "title": "State Dependent Optimization with Quantum Circuit Cutting",
    "summary": "Quantum circuits can be reduced through optimization to better fit the constraints of quantum hardware. One such method, initial-state dependent optimization (ISDO), reduces gate count by leveraging knowledge of the input quantum states.   Surprisingly, we found that ISDO is broadly applicable to the downstream circuits produced by circuit cutting. Circuit cutting also requires measuring upstream qubits and has some flexibility of selection observables to do reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a state-dependent optimization (SDO) framework that incorporates ISDO, our newly proposed measure-state dependent optimization (MSDO), and a biased observable selection strategy. Building on the strengths of the SDO framework and recognizing the scalability challenges of circuit cutting, we propose non-separate circuit cutting-a more flexible approach that enables optimizing gates without fully separating them.   We validate our methods on noisy simulations of QAOA, QFT, and BV circuits. Results show that our approach consistently mitigates noise and improves overall circuit performance, demonstrating its promise for enhancing quantum algorithm execution on near-term hardware.",

    "summary": "Three-color Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of room-temperature Rb vapor in the presence of inert gases (Ar, Ne, and N$_2$) at 50~mTorr and 500~mTorr is investigated. The observed EIT lines shift and develop blue-detuned satellite lines, dependent on inert-gas species and pressure. The separations of the satellite from the main EIT lines are approximately pressure-independent, while their strength increases with inert-gas pressure. The satellite lines are attributed to hyperfine collisions of the intermediate $5D_{3/2}$ state. Further, analyzing the Stark effect of Rydberg levels, it is found that the inert gases suppress static electric fields in the vapor cells, which we induce by photo-illumination of the cell walls with an auxiliary 453-nm laser. In the work, we utilize Rydberg levels with principal quantum numbers $n$ = 25 and 50 and angular momenta $\\ell$ = 3 up to 6, excited by the EIT lasers and optional radio-frequency dressing fields.

Our primary focus is to evaluate the robustness of entanglement as a resource for quantum information protocols such as dense coding, teleportation, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering under the influence of noise. In addition, we investigate the behaviour of other quantum correlations, including quantum discord and coherence, and analyze their hierarchy under decoherence. To counteract the detrimental effects of the channels, we apply the weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal (WMR) protocol, comparing the effectiveness of single-qubit and two-qubit WMR techniques. Our results show that the two-qubit WMR protocol significantly outperforms the single-qubit approach in preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we employ a neural network model to enhance our analysis of the relationship between different quantum correlation measures during the evolution. Using a MATLAB-based artificial neural network with 80 neurons across three hidden layers and trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we successfully predict trace distance discord from other correlations, achieving low prediction errors. Besides, our analysis of the neural network weights suggests that concurrence and EPR steering have the most positive influence on the accurate discord predictions.",

The typical solution to this challenge is either using different quantum phenomena for different types of random number, or converting one distribution of random numbers to another type. However, the former solution requires multiple hardware systems, while the latter one sacrifices a lot of secure bits. Here, we develop a quantum random number generator that can on-demand produce three distribution types of random numbers at over 60 Gbits/s (Gbps) raw bits by measuring the quantum vacuum noise. After randomness extraction, over 42 Gbps secure bit rate is demonstrated for uniform random numbers, and over 14 Gbps secure bit rate for Gaussian random number. Due to the lack of Rayleigh randomness extraction, only denoised Rayleigh raw bits are generated. Switching between different types of random numbers is achieved in electronics, which does not affect the generation rate. The random numbers pass NIST and Dieharder tests, and are available for various applications, which can be continuously accessed via Cisco Quantum Random Number web service.",

By analytically deriving the second-order coherence $g^{(2)}(0)$, we show that quantum interference between the non-orthogonal squeezed components allows for precise tuning of photon statistics into regimes forbidden to individual squeezed states, achieving a minimum $g^{(2)}$ value as low as $0.567$.

It does so by decomposing the evolution into pathways between the computational basis states, where each pathway has an associated complex amplitude. The magnitude of a pathway amplitude determines its significance and many pathways constructively and/or destructively interfere to produce the final evolution of the system. In this paper, we apply Hamiltonian encoding to reveal the mechanism behind creating qubit gates implemented via optimal control pulses. An X gate, two CNOT gates, and a SWAP gate are examined to determine the degree of interference involved and to demonstrate that different optimal controls produce distinct mechanisms. Although the detailed mechanism for creating any gate depends on the nature of the control field, the mechanism analysis tools are generic. The presented gates and their mechanisms in this paper are thus illustrative and a researcher may apply these same tools to any gate with a suitable optimal control field.",

However, so far only examples of simple, unstructured information, such as a value of an observable, have been studied. In this work we show that a more complicated form of information, given by a Cartesian reference frame, can also be made (at least partially) objective in quantum mechanics. The non-trivial internal gauge structure of reference frames, given by the transformation group, leads to a more general form of objectivity, where all observers see the same but modulo their relative orientations, like it happens in modern understanding of geometry. This opens a way to extend quantum objectivity beyond simple scenarios and possibly link it to the foundations of modern geometry.",

    "summary": "Understanding the influence of realistic noise on quantum algorithms is paramount for the advancement of quantum computation. While often modeled as Markovian, environmental noise in quantum systems frequently exhibits temporal correlations, leading to non-Markovian dynamics that can significantly alter algorithmic performance. This paper investigates the impact of temporally correlated dephasing noise, modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, on the fidelity of the 2-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We perform numerical simulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength ($\\sigma_{\\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\\tau_c$) of the OU process. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm's fidelity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\\tau_c$, particularly at higher noise strengths, with certain intermediate correlation times proving more detrimental than others. We find that a standard Markovian dephasing model, matched to the single-step error variance of the OU process, accurately predicts fidelity only in the limit of very short correlation times. For longer correlation times, the Markovian approximation often overestimates the algorithm's fidelity, failing to capture the complex error dynamics introduced by the noise memory. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian characteristics for accurate performance assessment of quantum algorithms on near-term devices and underscore the limitations of simpler, memoryless noise models.",

However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D. Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our findings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT description and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their computational treatment.",

We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos.

In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However, such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum.

We demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape--akin to cutting off the ever-regenerating heads of a dragon. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states (dragon heads to be cut). We found that this quantum-assisted training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a notably higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.",

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Provably Efficient Algorithms to Estimate Shapley Values",
    "summary": "Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco & Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods, tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results compared to the KernelSHAP library.",

Using the principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.",

    "summary": "Computational models typically assume that operations are applied in a fixed sequential order. In recent years several works have looked at relaxing this assumption, considering computations without any fixed causal structure and showing that such ''causally indefinite'' computations can provide advantages in various tasks. Recently, the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions has been used as a tool to probe their computational power in a standard complexity theoretic framework, but no separation in exact query complexity has thus-far been found. In this paper, we investigate this problem starting with the simpler and fully classical notion of deterministic query complexity of Boolean functions, and using classical-deterministic processes -- which may exhibit causal indefiniteness -- as a generalised computational framework. We first show that the standard polynomial and certificate lower bounds of deterministic query complexity also hold in such generalised models. Then, we formulate a Boolean function for which causal indefiniteness permits a reduction in query complexity and show that this advantage can be amplified into a polynomial separation. Finally, with the insights gained in the classical-deterministic setting, we give a Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is reduced by causally indefinite computations.",

By transitioning from the perturbative to the non-perturbative REMPI regime, we identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP). Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution (3D PMD), which we trace back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in anti-phase, leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of the $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.",

Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions -- a framework to analyze far from equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.",

We report on a precise, minimally-destructive measurement technique that can be used to prepare an atomic ensemble with a desired atom number. The measurement relies on the dispersive light-atom interaction, thus it is expected to have a negligible effect on the ensemble temperature and to induce minimal decoherence in the atomic quantum state.

We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation.

Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions.

We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing.

However, in photonic platforms this remains technologically challenging due to photon loss, which opens the detection-loophole, rendering violations increasingly difficult for less efficient detectors. A well-known strategy to mitigate this involves using non-maximally entangled states, which Eberhard showed can tolerate lower detection efficiencies. However, existing proposals and demonstrations have been limited to short distances, as their success rates scale linearly with channel transmittance. Here, we propose a protocol to herald a tunable entangled state between distant users that achieves a post-selection-free Bell inequality violation at the Eberhard limit. We identify the loss independence of the vacuum component amplitude of the prepared state as the source of this enhancement. Notably, our scheme requires only quantum interference at a central station, followed by the detection of a single photon, preserving the optimal square-root scaling with channel transmittance. Our approach provides greater loss-tolerance in entanglement distribution, bringing long-distance DI applications closer to practical implementation.",

Despite its proposed significance in photosynthesis, there has been no direct experimental detection of supertransfer because, in biological or molecular systems, delocalisation cannot be turned on and off to evaluate its effect on energy transfer. Here, we show that supertransfer could be directly observed using a quantum device based on a superconducting circuit. The programmability and control offered by an engineered device would allow controllable delocalisation of quantum states, giving full tunability over supertransfer.

Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems.

Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations.

Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.",

In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin $j$ grows and eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.",

The underpinning hardware must be engineered to generate, manipulate and detect quantum phenomena with exceptional performance, whilst being mass-manufacturable for real-world applications. A leading approach is chip-scale quantum photonics. The continuous-variable regime for quantum optics has been exploited in a number of technologies, including the detection of gravitational waves, by operating below the standard quantum limit of the light's shot noise. The availability of room-temperature, deterministic sources and high efficiency detectors suitable for continuous-variable state generation and measurement is a compelling motivation for this particular paradigm. This review focusses on efforts to integrate sources and detectors of continuous-variable light states into chip-scale photonic integrated circuits.",

    "summary": "We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum R\\'enyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.",

Hence, we focus on the joint optimization of the location of charging stations and the routing of EVs. When routing problems are formulated in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), specialized solvers such as quantum annealer are expected to provide optimal solutions with high speed and accuracy. However, battery capacity constraints make it hard to formulate into QUBO form without a large number of auxiliary qubits. Then, we propose a sequential optimization method utilizing the Bayesian inference and QUBO solvers, in which method the battery capacity constraints are automatically learned. This method enables us to optimize the number and location of charging stations and the routing of EVs with a small number of searches. Applying this method to a routing problem of 20 locations, we confirmed that the learning process works well and efficient searches find good solutions. This result enhances the possibility that the QUBO solver could be applied to the constraints contained problems which is difficult to formulate into QUBO form without a large number of ancilla qubits.",

In such problem settings, variational and non-variational methods commonly incorporate penalty terms into the original Hamiltonian to enforce the desired constraints. While in variational approaches, only $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^2)$ measurements are required for the calculation of the penalty terms for the total spin magnitude, non-variational approaches, such as probabilistic imaginary-time evolution or adiabatic time evolution, are expected to be more computationally intensive, requiring $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^4)$ gates naively. This paper proposes a new procedure based on non-variational quantum algorithms to obtain the spin-adapted ground state. The proposed method consists of two steps: the first step is to prepare a spin-magnitude adapted state and the second step is post-processing for the desired $S_z$. By separating into two steps, the procedure achieves the desired spin-adapted ground state while reducing the number of penalty terms from $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^4)$ to $O(n_{\\textrm{spin}}^2)$.

In particular, we focus on strongly symmetric maximally mixed states arising from the Temperley-Lieb model, which features quantum Hilbert space fragmentation with exponentially large (in system size) non-Abelian commutants. We find that while both the logarithmic negativity and the `exact' entanglement cost for equal-size bipartitions scale with the volume of the system, the entanglement of formation, squashed entanglement, entanglement cost, and distillable entanglement exhibit subextensive scaling. We relate this separation in entanglement measures to a parametric difference between the entanglement cost of exact and asymptotically-exact state preparations, and infer this to be a consequence of a particular pattern of quantum Hilbert space fragmentation.",

The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed, revealing that the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and the pseudo-magnetic flux are topologically governed by the surface geometry. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation.

In all cases, the observable identified as the cosmological constant is six times the Hamiltonian. In particular, for a closed Universe ($k=1$), spacetime exhibits a cyclic evolution along which the scalar curvature is constant and finite, thereby avoiding singularities. The quantum theory is reached by using canonical quantization. We calculate the spectrum of the observable corresponding to the cosmological constant.

Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior.

It works by decomposing the inverse channel of each gate or each circuit layer into the identity part and the non-identity part and reorganizing the full circuit as different powers of the inverse generator. The ideal circuit becomes a linear combination of noisy circuits with different weights where shots are deterministically allocated to each circuit based on its weight. This naturally sets the achievable bias given a finite amount of shots. As the number of shots is increased, smaller bias terms can be gradually resolved and become bias-free in the limit of sufficient shots. We show the saving both analytically and numerically over the standard PEC and identify situations where it can outperform heuristic approach, such as zero-noise extrapolation, due to the well-controlled bias. We also demonstrated this method experimentally and found excellent agreement between the mitigated and the ideal values.",

Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy.

L\\'evy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the L\\'evy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the L\\'evy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.",

    "summary": "More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.",

We show a way to implement these algorithms avoiding expensive block encoding and relying only on dense local circuits, akin to Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically, our method leverages spatial truncation and Trotterization of exact quasilocal dissipative processes. We rigorously prove that the approximations we use have little effect on rapid mixing at high temperatures and allow convergence to the thermal state with small bounded error. Moreover, we accompany our analytical results with numerical simulations that show that this method, unlike previously thought, is within the reach of current generation of quantum hardware.

This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field.

We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques.

    "summary": "For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e. a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: \\emph{mixed-state bootstrap program}.   From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical -- demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability-weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.",

    "summary": "The simulation of entangled ground-states of quantum materials remains challenging for classical computational methods in more than one spatial dimension, and is a prime target for quantum computational advantage. To this end, an important goal is to identify efficient quantum state preparation protocols that minimize the physical qubit number and circuit depth resources required to capture higher-dimensional quantum correlations. This work introduces a quantum circuit compression algorithm for Gaussian fermion states based on the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which provides an exponential reduction in the circuit depth required to approximate highly-entangled ground-states relevant for quantum materials simulations. The algorithm, termed two-dimensional Gaussian MERA ($2d$ GMERA), extends MERA techniques to compress higher-dimensional Gaussian states. Through numerical simulations of the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice, the method is shown to accurately capture area-law entangled states including topologically trivial insulators, Chern insulators, and critical Dirac semimetals. While Gaussian states alone are classically simulable, this approach establishes empirical upper bounds on quantum resources needed to prepare free fermion states that are adiabatically connected to correlated ground states, providing guidance for implementing these protocols on near-term quantum devices and offering a foundation for simulating more complex quantum materials. Finally, we develop a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme, based on an expanding $2d$ topological order, that enables implementing fermionic rotations via qubit Pauli rotations with constant Pauli weight independent of system size.",

While the unitary encoders can be used to increase the code distance, the fault-distance remains fixed. Nonetheless, they can be used for space-time efficient realization of eigenstates of the surface code operators that can't be easily accessed transversally such as the Pauli Y-eignestate and Clifford eigenstates. It may be expected that error propagation in the non-local circuit will make decoding more challenging compared to local unitary encoding circuits. However, we find this not to be the case and that conventional matching decoders can be effectively used. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to benchmark the performance of our encoder against a previous local unitary encoder and the conventional stabilizer-measurement based encoder for preparing the Pauli Y-eigenstate and find that our encoder can outperform these in experimentally relevant noise regimes. Therefore, our encoder provides practical advantage in platforms where non-local interactions are available such as neutral atoms and trapped ions.",

However, these methods are not reflective of the entire gate set of the quantum device and may need further tuning depending on the distance from the most recent calibration time. This paper proposes a method of improvement to numerical readout error techniques, where the readout error model is further refined using measured probability distributions from a collection of low-depth circuits. We use machine learning to improve the readout error model for the quantum system, testing the circuits on the simulated IBM Perth backend using Qiskit. We demonstrate a median 6.6% improvement in fidelity, 29.9% improvement for mean-squared error, and 10.3% improvement in Hellinger distance over the standard error mitigation approach for a seven-qubit system with a circuit depth of four. With further focus directed towards such improvement of these error mitigation techniques, we are one step closer to the fault-tolerant quantum computing era.",

    "summary": "We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.",

    "summary": "Nonlinear modifications of quantum theory are considered potential candidates for the theory of quantum gravity, with the intuitive argument that since Einstein field equations are nonlinear, quantum gravity should be nonlinear as well. Contextuality is a property of quantum systems that forbids the explanation of prepare-and-measure experiments in terms of classical hidden variable models with suitable properties. We show that some well-known nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, namely the Deutsch's map, the Weinberg's model, and the Schr\\\"odinger - Newton equation, map a contextual set of states to a non-contextual one. That is, the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory allow for the existence of classical hidden variable models for certain experimental setups. This enables us to design experiments that would rule out the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory by verifying that the system remains contextual, or, equivalently, our results highlight a mechanism how nonlinear modification of quantum theory may lead to weak wave function collapse and ultimately to the solution of the measurement problem.",

Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.",

With recent development, quantum computing when mature   may allow an effective approach for various combinatorial problems,   including entailment checking.   Grover algorithm uses Grover operations, selective phase inversion and amplitude amplification   to address a search over unstructured data with quadratic improvement from a classical method.   Its original form is intended to a single-winner scenario: exactly one match is promised.   Its extension to multiple-winner cases employs probabilistic control over   a number of applications of Grover operations, while a no-winner case is handled by time-out.   Our study explores various schemes of ``eigenmarking'' approach.   Still relying on Grover operations, but the approach introduces additional qubits   to tag the eigenstates.   The tagged eigenstates are to facilitate an interpretation of the measured results and   enhance identification of a no-winner case (related to no logic violation in entailment context).

Our analysis reveals that R3BIs eliminate baseband and zero-wavenumber-gain MIs, forming, instead, phonon modes that enable stable boselets.

    "summary": "Superconducting quantum circuits rely on strong drives to implement fast gates, high-fidelity readout, and state stabilization. However, these drives can induce uncontrolled excitations, so-called \"ionization\", that compromise the fidelity of these operations. While now well-characterized in the context of qubit readout, it remains unclear how general this limitation is across the more general setting of parametric control. Here, we demonstrate that a nonlinear coupler, exemplified by a transmon, undergoes ionization under strong parametric driving, leading to a breakdown of coherent control and thereby limiting the accessible gate speeds. Through experiments and numerical simulations, we associate this behavior with the emergence of drive-induced chaotic dynamics, which we characterize quantitatively using the instantaneous Floquet spectrum. Our results reveal that the Floquet spectrum provides a unifying framework for understanding strong-drive limitations across a wide range of operations on superconducting quantum circuits. This insight establishes fundamental constraints on parametric control and offers design principles for mitigating drive-induced decoherence in next-generation quantum processors.",

In the context of quantum technologies, systems with memory can be used in quantum information, communication, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate that cavity optomechanical systems driven by a pulsed laser can operate as programmable quantum memory elements. By engineering the adiabatic and non-adiabatic pulses, particularly the Gaussian and sinusoidal, we induce and control diverse memory phenomena such as dynamical hysteresis, quantized phononic transitions, and distinct energy-storing responses. Within a mean-field approach, we derive the analytical and numerical criteria under which the photonic and phononic observables manifest the memory effects in strongly driven regimes. The memory effects are quantified through a dimensionless geometric form factor, which provides a versatile metric to characterize the memory efficiency. Our protocol is readily compatible with the current optomechanical platforms, highlighting the new possibilities for advanced memory functionalities in quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\\sqrt{i\\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.",

While unitary dynamics preserve global purity, expectation values of observables often exhibit equilibration-like behavior, raising the question of whether complexity can track this process. In addition to examining observable equilibration, we extend our analysis to study how the complexity of the quantum states evolves, providing insight into the transition from initial coherence to equilibrium. We define a classical statistical complexity measure based on observable entropy and deviation from equilibrium, which captures the dynamical progression towards equilibration and effectively distinguishes between complex and non-complex trajectories. In particular, our measure is sensitive to non-complex dynamics, such as the quasi-periodic behavior exhibited by low effective dimension initial states, where the systems explore a limited region of the Hilbert space as they oscillate in an informational coherence-preserving manner. These findings are supported by numerical simulations of an Ising-like non-integrable Hamiltonian spin-chain model. Our work provides new insight into the emergence of equilibrium behavior from unitary dynamics and advances complexity as a meaningful tool in the study of the emergence of classicality in microscopic systems.",

Namely, first we establish hardness in the following sense: Let $U=e^{-iHt}$ be an NH gate on $n$ qubits whose smallest and largest singular values differ by at least $2^{-\\text{poly}(n)}$. Together with any universal set of unitary gates, the ability to apply such a gate lets one efficiently emulate postselection. The resulting model decides every language in PostBQP; hence, under standard complexity conjectures, fully scalable NH quantum computers are unlikely to be engineered. Second, we establish upper bounds which show that conversely, any non-Hermitian evolution can be written as a unitary on a system-meter pair followed by postselecting the meter. This ``purification'' is compact -- it introduces only $O(\\delta^{2})$ Trotter error per time step $\\delta$ -- so any NH model whose purification lies in a strongly simulable unitary family (e.g., Clifford, matchgate, or low-bond-dimension tensor-network circuits) remains efficiently simulable.

In the present work we propose to combine the Stark coupling with the two-photon QRM to realize a tunable critical point so that the nonlinear critical quantum metrology can be globalized. As demonstrated by the diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) the protocol enables us to acquire a high measurement precision in a wide range of coupling parameter rather than locally at a single critical point. Moreover, We find that the QFI not only manifests criticality but also exhibits universality. As a particular merit of our protocol, a strong squeezing can be globally retained as the leading quantum resource, while at the same time the PTPS remains in a finite order.",

While optimal absorption strategies based on time-reversal symmetry have shown promise for single emitters, their applicability is limited in realistic multi-qubit systems where realistic losses break time-reversal symmetry. This work introduces a robust approach using complex frequency (CF) pulses specifically tailored to the complex reflection zeros of the complete, coupled, and explicitly lossy qubit-waveguide system. This method circumvents the limitations of idealized time-reversal arguments by directly engaging with the dissipative system's true response characteristics. We first develop a theoretical framework for a system of three coupled two-level emitters, employing Heisenberg equations to derive the system's response and design appropriate CF pulses that inherently account for the system's dissipative nature. The efficacy and practicality of this approach are then validated through comprehensive transient simulations for a realistic model of three Josephson junction-based transmon qubits, explicitly including intrinsic qubit losses. Our results demonstrate that CF pulses can selectively excite a target qubit with significantly suppressed crosstalk to neighboring qubits, markedly outperforming conventional Gaussian pulses of comparable energy.",

Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies.

Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, $T\\sim 1/p$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.",

    "summary": "Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.",

Here, we introduce the perfect entangler spectrum as a means to identify dynamic crosstalk leading to undesired entanglement. It leverages the geometric classification of two-qubit gates in terms of perfect entanglers. We exemplify application of the spectroscopy for fixed-frequency transmons and parametrically driven gates: When scanning the frequency of a spectator qubit, peaks in the perfect entangler spectrum signal dynamic crosstalk, and analysis of the peaks reveals the mechanisms causing the crosstalk. We discuss the experimental implementation of the crosstalk spectroscopy which requires two two-qubit gate tomographies.",

We present a scalable distributed memory implementation of the Mask Assisted Coarse Graining of Influence Coefficients (MACGIC) - Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral (-QUAPI) method that exploits the memory resources of multiple compute nodes and mitigates the memory bottleneck of the method via a new pre-merging algorithm while preserving numerical accuracy. The distributed memory implementation spreads the paths over the computing nodes by means of the MPI protocoll and efficient high level path management is achieved via an implementation based on hash maps. The efficiency of the new implementation is demonstrated in large-scale dissipative quantum dynamics simulations that account for the coupling to a structured non-Markovian environment containing a sharp resonance, a setup for which convergence properties are investigated in depth. Broad applicability and the non-perturbative nature of the simulation method is illustrated via the tuning of the mode resonance frequency of the structured environment with respect to the system frequency. The simulations reveal a splitting of resonances due to strong system-environment interaction and the emergence of sidebands due to multi-excitations of the bosonic mode that are not accounted for in perturbative approaches. The simulations demonstrate the versatility of the new MACGIC-QUAPI method in the presence of strong non-Markovian system bath correlations.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel combination of constraint encoding methods for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Ansatz (QAOA). Real-world optimization problems typically consist of multiple types of constraints. To solve these optimization problems with quantum methods, typically all constraints are added as quadratic penalty terms to the objective. However, this technique expands the search space and increases problem complexity. This work focuses on a general workflow that extracts and encodes specific constraints directly into the circuit of QAOA: One-hot constraints are enforced through $XY$-mixers that restrict the search space to the feasible sub-space naturally. Inequality constraints are implemented through oracle-based Indicator Functions (IF). We test the performance by simulating the combined approach for solving the Multi-Knapsack (MKS) and the Prosumer Problem (PP), a modification of the MKS in the domain of electricity optimization. To this end, we introduce computational techniques that efficiently simulate the two presented constraint architectures. Since $XY$-mixers restrict the search space, specific state vector entries are always zero and can be omitted from the simulation, saving valuable memory and computing resources. We benchmark the combined method against the established QUBO formulation, yielding a better solution quality and probability of sampling the optimal solution. Despite more complex circuits, the time-to-solution is more than an order of magnitude faster compared to the baseline methods and exhibits more favorable scaling properties.",

This result confirms our newly developed theoretical predictions that consider, differently from previous theoretical results, a finite frequency resolution in the detection. We compare the performance of this scheme against the conventional non-resolved case. Experimental data align well with the predictions of quantum estimation theory, demonstrating a significant reduction in the uncertainty. Due to the physics of the frequency-resolved HOM effect, the gain in precision is particularly high when the estimated time delay is much longer than the coherence time.",

We show that in asymmetric hypothesis testing, the optimal type-II error exponent is precisely characterized by the minimum output channel divergence, a new notion of quantum channel divergence in the worst-case scenario. This serves as a direct analog of the quantum Stein's lemma in the adversarial channel discrimination. Notably, the optimal error exponent can be achieved via simple non-adaptive strategies by the adversary, and its value can be efficiently computed despite its regularization. The strong converse property for quantum channel discrimination also holds in general. This adversarial quantum Stein's lemma is proved by new chain rules for measured and sandwiched relative entropies. Moreover, we derive a generalized version of the entropy accumulation theorem between two arbitrary sequences of quantum channels, extending the existing results from entropy to divergence and providing a solution to the dual formulation of the open problem presented in [IEEE FOCS, pp. 844-850 (2022)].",

This problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). However, the number of variables and constraints in such a formulation grows exponentially with the number of measurements, rendering it intractable for large measurement sets. In this work, we circumvent this problem by transforming the SDP into a hierarchy of linear programs that compute upper and lower bounds on the incompatibility robustness with a complexity that grows polynomially in the number of measurements. The hierarchy is guaranteed to converge and it can be applied to arbitrary measurements -- including non-projective POVMs -- in arbitrary dimensions. While convergence becomes impractical in high dimensions, in the case of qubits our method reliably provides accurate upper and lower bounds for the incompatibility robustness of sets with several hundred measurements in a short time using a standard laptop. We also apply our methods to qutrits, obtaining non-trivial upper and lower bounds in scenarios that are otherwise intractable using the standard SDP approach. Finally, we show how our methods can be used to construct local hidden state models for states, or conversely, to certify that a given state exhibits steering; for two-qubit quantum states, our approach is comparable to, and in some cases outperforms, the current best methods.",

The commonly used selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gate faces significant challenges in ultra-high-coherence cavities, where the weak dispersive shifts necessary for preserving high coherence typically result in prolonged gate times. Here, we propose a protocol to achieve high-fidelity SNAP gates that are orders of magnitude faster than the standard implementation, surpassing the speed limit set by the bare dispersive shift. We achieve this enhancement by dynamically amplifying the dispersive coupling via sideband interactions, followed by quantum optimal control on the Floquet-engineered system. We also present a unified perturbation theory that explains both the gate acceleration and the associated benign drive-induced decoherence, corroborated by Floquet-Markov simulations. These results pave the way for the experimental realization of high-fidelity, selective control of weakly coupled, high-coherence cavities, and expanding the scope of optimal control techniques to a broader class of Floquet quantum systems.",

Specifically, we excite the nuclear transition in a thin ThO$_2$ sample whose band gap ($\\sim$ 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). As a result, the excited nucleus can quickly decay by internal conversion, resulting in the ejection of electrons from the surface. By collecting these conversion electrons, nuclear spectroscopy can be recorded. Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy, this technique is compatible with materials whose work function is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study. Further, because ThO$_2$ can be made from spinless isotopes and the internal conversion decay process reduces the isomeric state lifetime to only $\\sim$10 $\\mu$s, allowing $\\sim$10$^8$ relative reduction in clock interrogation time, a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock could lead to a $\\sim$10$^4$ reduction in clock instability.",

    "summary": "Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.",

However, there is typically little to no improvement in precision with the use of non-classical states for measurements whose duration exceeds the decoherence time of the underlying quantum states. Measurements aimed at the ultimate possible precision are thus performed almost exclusively with classical states and, therefore, are constrained by the standard quantum limit. Here, we demonstrate that by using the phenomenon of subharmonic excitation, in combination with a recently demonstrated technique of Raman excitation of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of an electric field can be measured at a resolution below the standard quantum limit of the corresponding linear measurement. As the input states can be classical, this metrological gain persists to long timescales and improves the ultimate possible precision. While we demonstrate this technique using motional Raman subharmonic excitation of a single 40ca^+ ion through engineered Floquet states, this technique is expected to be extendable to other platforms, such as NV centers, solid-state qubits, and neutral atoms, where it can provide metrological gain for sensing across the radio frequency, microwave, and optical domains.",

Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method.

With transfer learning mechanics, our decoder is scalable for cases with different code distances. Our decoder provides a practical tool for quantum noise analysis and promotes the practicality of quantum error correction codes and quantum computing.",

Here we challenge this principle and show that adiabaticity can be violated even in arbitrarily slow processes. We introduce two new parameters, Instantaneous Transition Accumulation (ITA) and Instantaneous Transition Probability (ITP), to redefine the framework of adiabatic evolution. These parameters, grounded in cross-Berry connections and eigenstate amplitudes, reveal the dynamic and geometric factors governing adiabaticity. Using a new Phase Difference Manipulation (PDM) method, we control ITP and ITA to induce adiabaticity violation in a Landau-Zener (LZ) process. We experimentally demonstrate this counterintuitive phenomenon in a photonic waveguide system, where a slow LZ process defies adiabaticity, switching energy levels despite a fivefold slower evolution speed than a conventional adiabatic process. This discovery reshapes our understanding of quantum evolution and holds potential for quantum computing, topological physics, and photonic technologies.",

Notably, the coupling strength between the hexagonal ring resonator and the permalloy film increases with the thickness of the YIG film, despite a fixed permalloy film thickness, suggesting the presence of an indirect interaction channel mediated by resonator photons. To support these findings, we present a theoretical model that accurately reproduces the observed transmission spectra and reveals a nontrivial interdependence between the individual coupling strengths of YIG and permalloy to the resonator.

Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size.

This paper presents two methods for generating ensemble coherence from a fixed amount of entanglement. The first method involves applying a von Neumann measurement to one part of a non-maximally entangled bipartite state, resulting in a pair of non-orthogonal states whose coherence can equal the initial entanglement. The second method considers a class of symmetric observables capable of generating ensembles used in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols such as B92, BB84, and three-state QKD.

Our analysis identifies topological features unique to the honeycomb lattice. In particular, certain characteristic magnon modes (e.g., elliptical distortion and triangular distortion modes) acquire nontrivial Chern numbers absent in triangular-based SkXs. Moreover, contrary to predictions based on triangular spin-lattice SkXs, we find that the counterclockwise (CCW)-breathing magnonic gap exhibits topological behavior only at large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI), losing its universality with decreasing DMI strength. Meanwhile, the second magnon gap consistently hosts robust TESs across the entire range of DMI and magnetic fields studied, closing at critical fields through field-induced topological phase transitions. The study further uncovers a remarkable richness in the magnon topology, identifying 65 distinct topological magnon phases generated by magnetic-field-driven skyrmion deformation.

Remarkably, transmon qubits based on tantalum-capped niobium (Nb/Ta) capacitive pads and aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs) maintained T1 lifetimes near 300 {\\mu}s even when cooled in fields as high as 600 mG. Both trapped flux up to 600 mG and applied fields up to 400 mG reduced T1 fluctuations by more than a factor of two, while higher field strengths caused rapid coherence degradation. We attribute this stabilization to the polarization of paramagnetic impurities, the role of trapped flux as a sink for non-equilibrium quasiparticles (QPs), and partial saturation of fluctuating two-level systems (TLSs). These findings challenge the conventional view that magnetic fields are inherently detrimental and introduce a strategy for mitigating noise in superconducting qubits, offering a practical path toward more stable and scalable quantum systems.",

    "summary": "An intriguing consequence of quantum field theory is that vacuum is not empty space; it is full of quantum fluctuating electromagnetic fields, or virtual photons, corresponding to their zero-point energy, even though the average number of photons is zero. These short-lived vacuum fluctuations are behind some of the most fascinating physical processes in the universe, including spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the Casimir force. Recent theory and experiments indicate that the properties of materials placed in photonic cavities may be altered, even in the complete absence of any external fields, through interaction with the fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields. Judicious engineering of the quantum vacuum surrounding the matter inside a cavity can lead to significant and nonintuitive modifications of electronic and vibrational states, producing a ``vacuum dressed'' material. These exciting new ideas have stimulated discussions regarding the fundamental physics of vacuum-matter interactions and also broadened the scope of potential applications using zero-point fluctuations to engineer materials. This Perspective will first discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments on vacuum-modified condensed matter systems, which usually require the realization of the so-called ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime. Then, we will overview some of the most promising cavity designs for enhancing vacuum electromagnetic fields in materials with various energy scales. Finally, we will discuss urgent open questions and technical challenges to be solved in this emerging field.",

    "summary": "While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.",

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.",

    "summary": "Quantum light pulses (QLPs) can be described by spatio-temporal modes, each of which is associated with a quantum state. In the mid-infrared spectral range, electro-optic sampling (EOS) provides a means to characterize quantum fluctuations in the electric field of such light pulses. Here, we present a protocol based on the two-port EOS technique that enables the complete characterization of multimode Gaussian quantum light, demonstrating robustness to both the shot noise and cascading effects. We validate this approach theoretically by reconstructing a multimode squeezed state of light generated in a thin nonlinear crystal driven by a single-cycle pulse. Our findings establish the two-port EOS technique as a versatile tool for characterizing ultrafast multimode quantum light, thereby broadening the reach of quantum state tomography. Potential applications include the characterization of complex quantum structures, such as correlations and entanglement in light and matter. Further, extensions to study multimode non-Gaussian QLPs can be envisaged.",

Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative, though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.",

First, we consider scenarios in which a simplicial complex is specified in a more informative form, enabling alternative quantum algorithms to estimate Betti numbers and persistent Betti numbers. We then move beyond Betti numbers and study the problem of testing the homology class of a given cycle, as well as distinguishing between homology classes.

    "summary": "Sampling problems are widely regarded as the task for which quantum computers can most readily provide a quantum advantage. Leveraging this feature, the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo [Layden, D. et al., Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] has been proposed recently, where sampling from a quantum computer is used as a proposal distribution and convergence to a target distribution is accelerated. However, guaranteeing convergence to the target distribution typically forces one to impose restrictive symmetry constraints on the quantum circuit, which makes it hard to design good proposal distributions and prevents making full use of the advantage of a quantum computer. We explore a hybrid quantum-classical MCMC framework that combines a quantum circuit with a generative neural sampler (GNS). The GNS is trained on quantum samples and acts as a classical surrogate to efficiently emulate quantum outputs, thereby lifting circuit constraints. We apply this method to Boltzmann sampling of spin glasses using proposals trained with a QAOA circuit. This approach outperforms conventional methods, showing a $\\sim$100$\\times$ improvement in spectral gap over uniform proposals. Notably, it maintains similar acceleration even without parameter optimization. These results establish the method as a viable sampling-based quantum algorithm for NISQ devices and highlight its potential for solving practical problems with quantum computation.",

    "summary": "Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\\Phi^+\\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.",

The performance of DI-CKA, however, is strictly limited because of its susceptibility to losses due e.g. to imperfect detection efficiency and channel transmission. Here, we propose a DI-CKA protocol which reduces this limitation by using a heralding scheme to distribute multipartite entanglement.

However, the Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli equation.

While quantum enhanced clustering models have demonstrated promising performance gains, their interpretability remains limited, restricting their application in sensitive domains such as financial fraud detection and blockchain governance. To address this gap, we propose a two stage analysis framework that synergistically combines quantitative clustering evaluation with AI Agent assisted qualitative interpretation. In the first stage, we employ classical clustering methods and evaluation metrics including the Silhouette Score, Davies Bouldin Index, and Calinski Harabasz Index to determine the optimal cluster count and baseline partition quality. In the second stage, we integrate an AI Agent to generate human readable, semantic explanations of clustering results, identifying intra cluster characteristics and inter cluster relationships. Our experiments reveal that while fully trained Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) outperform random Quantum Features (QF) in quantitative metrics, the AI Agent further uncovers nuanced differences between these methods, notably exposing the singleton cluster phenomenon in QNN driven models. The consolidated insights from both stages consistently endorse the three cluster configuration, demonstrating the practical value of our hybrid approach.

    "summary": "We demonstrate the effect of inter-atomic interaction in highly excited Rydberg atoms via Autler- Townes splitting in cold atoms. We measure the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of the 5S1/2, F=2 to 5P3/2, F'=3 transition of 87Rb atoms arising due to the strong coupling of the transition via the cooling beams used for the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The AT splitting is probed using a weakly coupled transition from 5P3/2, F'=3 state to highly excited Rydberg states for a wide range of principal quantum numbers (n = 35 - 117). We observe the AT splitting via trap-loss spectroscopy in the MOT by scanning the probe frequency. We observe a drastic increase in the broadening of the AT splitting signal as a result of interaction-induced dephasing effect in cold Rydberg atoms for highly excited Rydberg states with principal quantum number n > 100. We explain our observations using theoretical modelling and numerical simulations based on the Lindblad Master equation. We find a good agreement of the results of the numerical simulation with the experimental measurements.",

Starting from the canonical Heisenberg algebra defined by the commutation relation $[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar$ on a Hilbert space \\cite{Zettili2009}, we survey a variety of $q$-deformed structures previously proposed by Wess \\cite{Wess2000}, Schm\\\"udgen \\cite{Schmudgen1999}, Wess--Schwenk \\cite{Wess-Schwenk1992}, Gaddis \\cite{Jasson-Gaddis2016}, and others. These frameworks involve position, momentum, and auxiliary operators that satisfy nontrivial commutation rules and algebraic relations incorporating deformation parameters. Our new $q$-$\\hbar$ Heisenberg algebra $\\mathcal{H}_q$ is generated by elements $\\hat{x}_\\alpha$, $\\hat{y}_\\lambda$, and $\\hat{p}_\\beta$ with $\\alpha, \\lambda, \\beta \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and is defined through generalized commutation relations parameterized by real constants $n, m, l$ and three dynamical functions $\\Psi(q)$, $\\Phi(q)$, and $\\Pi(q)$ depending on the deformation parameter $q$ and the generators. By selecting appropriate values for these parameters and functions, our framework recovers several well-known algebras as special cases, including the classical Heisenberg algebra for $q = 1$ and $\\Psi = 1$, $\\Phi = \\Pi = 0$, and various $q$-deformed algebras for $q \\neq 1$. The algebraic consistency of these generalizations is demonstrated through a series of explicit examples, and the resulting structures are shown to align with quantum planes \\cite{Yuri-Manin2010} and enveloping algebras associated with Lie algebra homomorphisms \\cite{Reyes2014a}. This construction offers a flexible and unified formalism for studying quantum deformations, with potential applications in quantum mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and quantum group theory.",

To answer this question in an architecture-independent manner, and to get a worst-case estimate, we should look at a linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, as this can be embedded in almost any qubit connectivity. Motivated by the above, here we describe a method which implements MC gates using no more than $\\sim 4k+8n$ CNOT gates -- up-to $60\\%$ reduction over state-of-the-art -- while allowing for complete flexibility to choose the locations of $n$ controls, the target, and a dirty ancilla out of $k$ qubits. More strikingly, in case $k \\approx n$, our upper bound is $\\sim 12n$ -- the best known for unrestricted connectivity -- and if $n = 1$, our upper bound is $\\sim 4k$ -- the best known for a single long-range CNOT gate over $k$ qubits -- therefore, if our upper bound can be reduced, then the cost of one or both of these simpler versions of MC gates will be immediately reduced accordingly. In practice, our method provides circuits that tend to require fewer CNOT gates than our upper bound for almost any given instance of MC gates.",

We present a statistical signal processing approach to QEM that estimates the most likely noiseless outputs from noisy quantum measurements. Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.",

Beginning with a logical state, we apply a random unitary error channel and subsequently measure stabilizer checks, resulting in a syndrome-dependent post-measurement state. By examining both this syndrome state and the associated syndrome distribution, we identify a phase transition in the behavior of the logical state. Below a critical error threshold pc, the syndrome state remains in the same logical state, enabling successful recovery of the code's logical information via suitable error-correction protocols. Above pc, however, the syndrome state shifts to a different logical state, signaling the breakdown of efficient error correction. Notably, this process can often induce an effective unitary rotation within the logical space. This transition is accompanied by qualitative changes in both the global and local features of the syndrome distribution. We refer to this phenomenon as a coherent error induced phase transition. To illustrate this transition, we present two classes of quantum error correcting code models the toric code and non-local random stabilizer codes thereby shedding light on the design and performance limits of quantum error correction under coherent errors.",

This work introduces the Quantum Skip Gate (QSG), a new unitary circuit primitive that extends ICO to coherently control whether an expensive quantum subroutine is executed, without mid-circuit measurement or loss of coherence. Unlike conventional ICO constructions that superpose gate sequences, the QSG superposes the presence or absence of operations themselves, enabling conditional quantum logic in a fully unitary setting. Demonstrated experimentally in a Grover-style search on IBM quantum hardware (n = 4, k = 3), the QSG reduces costly subroutine calls by 9-25 percent, achieving a 31-61 percent improvement in success-per-oracle efficiency relative to a fixed-order baseline. Noise-model simulations confirm and strengthen these efficiency gains (up to 45 percent) when using an optimized \"swap-out\" design. These results demonstrate that ICO can provide practical, coherence-preserving resource management, significantly reducing runtime costs and noise accumulation in near-term quantum algorithms.",

Identifying the Hamiltonian governing the evolution of a quantum system is a fundamental task in quantum learning theory. While previous works mostly focused on quantum spin systems, where quantum states can be seen as superpositions of discrete bit-strings, relatively little is known about Hamiltonian learning for continuous-variable quantum systems. In this work we focus on learning the Hamiltonian of a bosonic quantum system, a common type of continuous-variable quantum system. This learning task involves an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and unbounded operators, making mathematically rigorous treatments challenging. We introduce an analytic framework to study the effects of strong dissipation in such systems, enabling a rigorous analysis of cat qubit stabilization via engineered dissipation. This framework also supports the development of Heisenberg-limited algorithms for learning general bosonic Hamiltonians with higher-order terms of the creation and annihilation operators. Notably, our scheme requires a total Hamiltonian evolution time that scales only logarithmically with the number of modes and inversely with the precision of the reconstructed coefficients. On a theoretical level, we derive a new quantitative adiabatic approximation estimate for general Lindbladian evolutions with unbounded generators.

We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing.

Our experiment confirms that the ratio between the quasi-probabilities of the time-forward and any multiple time-reversal processes obeys a generalized Crooks QFT.

    "summary": "Graph states are a powerful class of entangled states with numerous applications in quantum communication and quantum computation. Local Clifford (LC) operations that map one graph state to another can alter the structure of the corresponding graphs, including changing the number of edges. Here, we tackle the associated edge-minimization problem: finding graphs with the minimum number of edges in the LC-equivalence class of a given graph. Such graphs are called minimum edge representatives (MER), and are crucial for minimizing the resources required to create a graph state. We leverage Bouchet's algebraic formulation of LC-equivalence to encode the edge-minimization problem as an integer linear program (ILP). We further propose a simulated annealing (SA) approach guided by the local clustering coefficient for edge minimization. We identify new MERs for graph states with up to 16 qubits by combining SA and ILP. We extend the ILP to weighted-edge minimization, where each edge has an associated weight, and prove that this problem is NP-complete. Finally, we employ our tools to minimize resources required to create all-photonic generalized repeater graph states using fusion operations.",

    "title": "The Einstein Equation from an Informational-Geometrical Equivalence",
    "summary": "While any observer perceives its immediate neighborhood as locally flat, the metric field deviates from Minkowski space to relate infinitesimal distances assigned by local observers at distinct spacetime points. In a quantum description, these events should emerge from interactions (and thus correlations) between quantum systems, with one of them acting as a reference frame that defines relational localization. In this context, the metric field connects distances between interactions (events) \\textit{from the perspective of} distinct physical local reference frames (LRFs). Building on this idea -- together with the connection between entanglement entropy and area (which, in turn, may be linked to the metric itself), and the fact that the Einstein equation does not require the explicit presence of these material frames -- we propose an \\emph{informational-geometrical equivalence} (IGE): for a sufficiently small spacelike region $ B $, let $\\rho_B $ and $ \\sigma_B$ denote the reduced states of the quantum fields and the LRF within $ B $, respectively. In this picture, the relational content of the entropy of the quantum fields as seen by the LRF -- quantified by the conditional entropy $ \\delta_\\rho S(\\rho_B | \\sigma_B) $ -- is encoded in the variation $ \\delta_{g,\\rho} S(\\rho_B) $ induced by a smooth geometric perturbation. When the reference frame has complete information about the infrared sector, this IGE recovers the semiclassical Einstein equation. Furthermore, considering the presence of quantum correlations between the system and the LRF reveals a positive cosmological constant related to the density of quantum correlation within $B$.",

In this paper, we apply the newly discovered theory of boundary quadruples to parameterize all $C_0$ contraction semigroups whose generators extend the Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian, and prove a variant of Tumulka's claim: all such evolutions are generated by the placement of (potentially nonlocal) absorbing boundary conditions on $\\psi$ along $\\partial \\Omega$.

However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures. This integration establishes a comprehensive pipeline for simulating quantum systems on emerging qubit-boson and fermion-boson hardware, paving the way for their large-scale usage.",

Moreover, in this case, propagation tends to remain ballistic, a characteristic feature of waveguide arrays. Conversely, disorder in the injection amplitude and phase tends to delocalize the wave function, with the latter having a more pronounced effect.

We find that we can polynomially reduce the total number of gates required for data loading, but we find no advantage in cost models that only count the number of non-Clifford gates. Furthermore, for realistic cost models and problem sizes, we find that it is possible to reduce the cost of parallel data loading by an order of magnitude or more. We present several applications of quantum mass production, including a scheme that uses parallel phase estimation to asymptotically reduce the gate complexity of state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating eigenvalues of the quantum chemical Hamiltonian, including both Clifford and non-Clifford gates, from $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(N_{orb}^2\\right)$ to $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(N_{orb}^{\\log_2 3}\\right)$, where $N_{orb}$ denotes the number of orbitals.

We find small examples with high encoding rate that perform well for a large range of bias. In the limit of large noise bias, the code reduces to two independent classical cellular automaton codes, giving a distance scaling better than is possible with 2D topological quantum codes. Our construction combines two classical cellular automaton codes, LDPC codes that were recently proposed for use with noise-biased cat qubits, related to each other by a reflection. Each stabilizer in the quantum code is obtained by multiplying an all-X stabilizer from the first code with an all-Z stabilizer from the second code, or the other way around. The result is a self-dual quantum code with a number of qubits equal to the sum of the input codes and stabilizer weight and locality determined by the input codes. Under strong noise bias, the effective distance of the quantum code approaches the distance of the input codes.

One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.",

This \"term-dropping\" protocol introduces global symmetries that go beyond the alternative framework of \"ungauging\" topological order in symmetry-deformed models and gives rise to models such as the $U(1)$TC or $XY$TC. These models inherit (emergent) subsystem symmetries (from the original 1-form symmetry of the TC) that can give rise to (subextensive) ground-state degeneracies, which can still be organized by the eigenvalues of Wilson loop operators. However, we demonstrate that these models do not support topological or fracton order (as has been conjectured in the literature) due to the loss of (emergent) gauge symmetry. An extreme deformation of the TC is the quantum dimer model (QDM), which we discuss along the family of symmetry-deformed models from the perspective of subsystem symmetries, sublattice modulation, and quantum order-by-disorder mechanisms resulting in rich phase diagrams.

In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems.

We introduce a straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation. The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning.

    "summary": "We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.",

As the number of controllable qubits continues to increase, there emerges a pressing demand for scalable and robust entanglement detection protocols that can maintain high detection capability while requiring minimal resources. By integrating the positive partial transposition criterion with variational quantum interference, we develop an entanglement detection protocol that requires moderate classical and quantum computation resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this protocol attains high detection capability using only shallow quantum circuits, outperforming several widely-used entanglement detection methods. The protocol also exhibits strong resilience to circuit noise, ensuring its applicability across different physical platforms. Experimental implementation on a linear optical platform successfully identifies entanglement in a three-qubit mixed state that cannot be detected by conventional entanglement witnesses. Drawing upon the full potential of quantum and classical resources, our protocol paves a new path for efficient entanglement detection.",

By defining the relative ergotropic gap, which quantifies the disparity between global and local ergotropy, we derive two independent analytical bounds that distinguish entangled from separable states. We show that for a broad class of quantum states, the bounds coincide, making the criterion both necessary and sufficient.

Here, we present a novel bias-field-free approach that labels the NV orientations via the direction of the microwave (MW) field in a variable-pulse-duration Ramsey sequence used to manipulate the spin ensemble. Numerical simulations demonstrate the possibility to isolate each orientation's signal with sub-nT accuracy even without precise MW field calibration, at only a moderate cost to sensitivity. We also provide proof-of-principle experimental validation, observing relevant features that evolve as expected with applied magnetic field.

Specifically, a coherently driven transmon can act as a source of incoherent noise to another circuit element coupled to it. By using a full quantum model and a semiclassical analysis, we perform the noise spectroscopy of the driven transmon coupled to a spectator two-level system (TLS), and we show that, in a certain limit, the interaction with the driven transmon can be modeled as a stochastic diffusive process driving the TLS.",

This design considers predictive performance with logarithmic complexity in training data and parameter count. We benchmark QTS against classical models on synthetic and real-world datasets, including geopotential height fields used in numerical weather prediction.

While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses, relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: 2-positivity is necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker -- yet still non-trivial -- universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.",

The disorder forces quantum states, confined to the $N+1$ dimensional completely symmetric space to penetrate the exponentially large $2^N$ dimensional Hilbert space of $N$ particles. In particular, we focus on the quantum kicked top as a Floquet system of $N$ qubits, and use linear entropy, measuring single qubit entanglement, to investigate the changes in the time scales and values of saturation when disorder is introduced. In the near-integrable regime of the kicked top, we study the robustness of quantum revivals to disorder. We also find that a classical calculation yields the quantum single qubit entanglement to remarkable accuracy in the disorder free limit. The disorder, on the other hand, is modeled in the form of noise which again fits well with the numerical calculations. We measure the extent to which the dynamics is retained within the symmetric subspace and its spreading to the full Hilbert space using different quantities. We show that increasing disorder drives the system to a chaotic phase in full Hilbert space, as also supported by the spectral statistics. We find that there is robustness to disorder in the system, and this is a function of how chaotic the kicked top is.",

Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength",

This evolution is carried out in incremental steps, and the ground state at each step is found by minimizing the energy using the parameter values corresponding to the previous minimum as a warm start to guide the search. As a first test case, the method is applied to several linear systems obtained by discretizing a one-dimensional heat flow equation with different physical assumptions and grid choices.

In the measurement of low-frequency electric fields, we discover that the Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction among atoms induce linear superposition of Rydberg states with different angular momentum that generates a first-order response corresponding to the signature of linear Stark effect. As the Rydberg atoms have excellent coupling strengths with electric fields, our results indicate that our method can hopefully reach high-precision performance for practical tasks in the future.",

The amplified quantum state, prepared using a quadratic number of alternating unitaries, achieves a constant average-case measurement probability for globally optimal solutions across these problem sizes. This behaviour contrasts with that of classical heuristics, which, for NP-hard optimisation problems, typically exhibit solve probabilities that decay as problem size increases. Performance comparisons with two local-search heuristics on the same benchmark instances suggest that the non-variational QWOA may offer a meaningful advantage by scaling more favourably with problem size. These results provide supporting evidence for the potential of this quantum heuristic to achieve quantum advantage, though further work is needed to assess whether the observed performance scaling persists at larger problem sizes, and to confirm whether similar performance trends are observed for the other problem classes to which the non-variational QWOA is designed to generalise.",

We present a method for birefringence compensation in an all-fiber detection setup that relies solely on coincidence measurements of a polarization-entangled state, or known correlations in a prepare-and-measure scenario. We define coincidence entropies as functions of the measured coincidence counts. These quantify the randomness of measurement outcomes, remain independent of the transmitted Bell state, and serve as indicators of the degree of entanglement. By leveraging coincidence entropy as a cost function in a gradient descent algorithm, we are able to align the polarization bases between two distinct polarization-sensitive receivers. Additionally, coincidence entropies can be employed to monitor the quality of entanglement transmission, thereby enhancing the system's ability to detect potential eavesdropping attempts, such as intercept-resend quantum attacks.",

The soundness of this protocol relies on Raz's (classical) memory lower bound for matrix inversion (Raz, FOCS 2016).   2. A protocol that achieves an exponential gap, building on techniques from the literature on the bounded storage model (Dodis et al., Eurocrypt 2023).   Both protocols are also efficiently verifiable.

In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced fermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a disordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not only from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially separated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from quasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as Andreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly shifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of the wire.

The required coupling to an ancillary control qubit, however, can negate these benefits by inducing highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. An important question is thus whether a cavity-qubit coupling can be realized that offers readout and control capabilities without spoiling the cavity. Here, motivated by its long lifetime and design flexibility of its Hamiltonian, we experimentally investigate the fluxonium as a control qubit for superconducting cavities. We couple a fluxonium qubit to a superconducting resonator in the strong-dispersive regime and use it to measure the coherence and inherited nonlinearities of the resonator. We then demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions, with fidelities limited by resonator decay in our planar prototype device. Finally, we use the predictability of the resonator's inherited nonlinearities to show numerically that the fluxonium can reach cavity-coupling regimes that eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities.

A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization.

To overcome this limitation we develop a framework comprising a noise characterisation method with minimal measurements allowing high temporal resolution, combined with a hierarchical discrete fluctuation auto-segmentation tool to disentangle the overlapping fluctuations without human intervention, enabling their characterisation and tracking over long times. We show that on transmon qubits the method can track and disentangle qubit frequency fluctuations with temporal resolution of a few tens of milliseconds over hours.

We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\\exp(-L |{M}^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\\scriptscriptstyle \\mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.",

However, they have a significantly reduced cadence of syndrome extraction compared to superconducting devices, a potentially crippling slow-down given the substantial logical gate counts required for quantum advantage. Transversal logic, which exploits higher connectivity, has the potential to significantly speed up the logical clock rate by reducing the number of syndrome extraction rounds required, but current decoders for fast transversal logic are not scalable. This is not just because existing decoders are too slow to handle the large decoding volumes resulting from fast logic; transversal logic breaks the key structural properties that make real-time decoding of lattice surgery efficient. We introduce two new, windowed decoding protocols for transversal logic in the surface code that restore modularity and locality to the decoding problem. Using our protocols, we show that, with a very small space overhead, our scalable decoders unlock an order of magnitude speed-up for transversal logic compared to lattice surgery. Taken together, our results provide key evidence for the viability of large-scale algorithms on AMO qubits.",

This paper proposes an online control framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level.

Such characterisation allows us to identify which particular thermodynamic principle is responsible for the (un)attainability of a given quantum operation or measurement. In the case of channels, i.e., trace-preserving operations, we show that a channel belongs to ($I$) and ($II$) if and only if it is strictly positive and rank non-decreasing, respectively, whereas a channel belongs to ($III$) only if it is rank non-decreasing and does not perturb a strictly positive state.

Tensor networks not only reduce the computational cost required for simulations by using approximations but are also deeply connected to entanglement. Entanglement is one of the most important elements for the quantum advantages of quantum algorithms, but the direct relationship between quantum advantages and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Tensor networks are promising as a means to address this question. In this study, we focus on the entanglement in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This study aims to investigate entanglement in QAOA by examining the relationship between the approximation rates of tensor networks and the performance of QAOA. Specifically, we actually perform tensor network simulations of QAOA on a classical computer and extend the study of the scaling relations presented in previous research. We have discovered that scaling relations hold even when entanglement entropy is used as the vertical axis. Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the numerical calculations, we propose a new function for the scaling relation. Additionally, we discovered interesting relationships regarding the behavior of entanglement in QAOA during our analysis.

In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide an effective description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.",

While the error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still high, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting information of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered magnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM with next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in the system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the ground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits are compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of VQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE succeeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits are then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without using any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect recovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state energy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we show that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable simulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE approach.",

We introduce the field by reviewing simple examples of superoscillations and showing how their existence naturally follows from the real part of the quantum mechanical weak value, which the parallel phenomena of supergrowth naturally follows from the imaginary part. Focusing on electromagnetic applications, we review the topics of superoscillation and supergrowth in speckle, creating superoscillating hot spots with patterned filters, superspectroscopic discrimination of two molecules, noise mitigation and the engineering of super behavior in point spread functions for the purpose of optical superresolution. We also cover a variety of different methods for creating superoscillatory and supergrowing functions, reviewing both mathematical and physical ways to create this class of functions, and beyond. Promising directions for future research, including superoscillations in other wave phenomena, super radar, and generalized super-phenomena in quantum physics, are outlined.",

    "summary": "We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving QUBO problems using an Imaginary Time Evolution-Mimicking Circuit (ITEMC). The circuit parameters are optimized to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, using only single- and two-qubit expectation values. This significantly reduces the measurement overhead by avoiding full energy evaluation. By updating the initial state based on results from last step iteratively, the algorithm quickly converges to the low-energy solutions. With a pre-sorting step that optimizes quantum gate ordering based on QUBO coefficients, the convergence is further improved. Our classical simulations achieve approximation ratios above 0.99 up to 150 qubits. Furthermore, the linear scaling of entanglement entropy with system size suggests that the circuit is challenging to simulate classically using tensor networks. We also demonstrate hardware runs on IBM's device for 40, 60, and 80 qubits, and obtain solutions compatible with that from simulated annealing.",

We demonstrate that, when operating according to a quantum Otto cycle, can surpass the classical efficiency limit by consuming the coherence of noisy quantum states. Computed Leggett-Garg temporal correlations imply the engine's non-classical nature. Amplitude damping significantly reduces efficiency and extractable work. In contrast, phase damping has no significant impact on the extractable work. We implement the entire Otto cycle in a quantum circuit, simulating realistic amplitude and phase damping channels, as well as gate-level noise. We introduce an operational measure of the circuit's thermodynamic cost, establishing a direct link between energy consumption and information processing in quantum heat engines.",

    "summary": "Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\\'erot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.",

    "summary": "The photon statistics of Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) exhibit dependencies on wavelength, pump power, and coincidence time. Notably, the average photon numbers were found to asymmetrically increase with increasing pump power around the degenerate wavelength of emission. By the coupling of the detection scheme to a spectrometer, studying different bandwidths within the emission revealed that shorter wavelengths increased nonlinearly with pump power, while longer wavelengths showed more linear behavior, indicating a wavelength dependent efficiency in the generation of the SPDC. We employ the use of a four detector Hanbury Brown and Twiss Interferometer to study the photon statistics of the signal beam, where the idler serves as the herald. The measured statistics were found to be best described by a Negative Binomial Distribution, which is a characteristic of thermal light sources. The detection and characterization of complex light sources has wide ranging applications in the fields of quantum metrology, quantum communications, and quantum computing, more specifically, a system that is sensitive to wavelength and photon number distribution.",

    "summary": "The prediction of material degradation is an important problem to solve in many industries. Environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, are important drivers of degradation processes, with corrosion being one of the most prominent ones. Quantum machine learning is a promising research field but suffers from well known deficits such as barren plateaus and measurement overheads. To address this problem, recent research has examined quantum reservoir computing to address time-series prediction tasks. Although a promising idea, developing circuits that are expressive enough while respecting the limited depths available on current devices is challenging. In classical reservoir computing, the onion echo state network model (ESN) [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72359-9_9] was introduced to increase the interpretability of the representation structure of the embeddings. This onion ESN model utilizes a concatenation of smaller reservoirs that describe different time scales by covering different regions of the eigenvalue spectrum. Here, we use the same idea in the realm of quantum reservoir computing by simultaneously evolving smaller quantum reservoirs to better capture all the relevant time-scales while keeping the circuit depth small. We do this by modifying the rotation angles which we show alters the eigenvalues of the quantum evolution, but also note that modifying the number of mid-circuit measurements accomplishes the same goals of changing the long-term or short-term memory. This onion QRC outperforms a simple model and a single classical reservoir for predicting the degradation of aluminum alloys in different environmental conditions. By combining the onion QRC with an additional classical reservoir layer, the prediction accuracy is further improved.",

    "summary": "Can quantum theory be applied on all scales? While there are many arguments for the universality of quantum theory, this question remains a subject of debate. It is unknown how far the existence of macroscopic irreversibility can be derived from or reconciled with time-reversal symmetric quantum dynamics. Furthermore, reasoning about quantum measurements can appear to produce surprising and even paradoxical outcomes. The classical outcomes of quantum measurements are in some contexts deemed to violate the fundamental principle of locality, in particular when considering entanglement and Bell non-locality. Therefore measurement, irreversibility and locality can all appear to challenge the universality of quantum theory. In this thesis we approach these problems using counterfactuals -- statements about the possibility and impossibility of transformations. Using the principles of constructor theory and quantum information theory, we find novel features of quantum thermodynamics relating to irreversibility, information erasure and coherence. We also develop tools to quantify the full implications of non-commutativity of quantum operators in settings where quantum theory is applied universally to measurement devices. This reveals new ways of characterising the quantum information stored in entanglement and quantum branching structure. Our results reinforce the ability of universal quantum theory to consistently describe both microscopic and macroscopic observers and thermodynamic systems.",

    "summary": "Tunneling ionization followed by strong-field excitation leads to important ultrafast phenomena such as charge migration and lasing. Recent theoretical developments suggest that the population of the ionic excited state can be greatly enhanced due to the complex interplay between tunneling and excitation. In this Letter, using an adiabatic approach for both tunneling and excitation, semi-analytical solutions are derived for the population and coherence of a two-level ionic system. This approach removes the strong-field dressing, revealing novel sub-half-cycle processes for excited state population and coherence buildup. It predicts that the excited state population is enhanced by an order of magnitude, independent of the laser wavelength, while coherence amplitude can be boosted by over four orders of magnitude for a multi-cycle pulse. For a single-cycle pulse, it suggests that coherence amplitude decreases rapidly as the wavelength increases. This work introduces a novel framework for generating and controlling the electronic excited state and coherence using intense laser pulses, with applications in strong-field control of chemistry and lasing.",

This protocol leverages the NJL vacuum's rich entanglement structure, driven by the chiral condensate, to facilitate energy transfer without physical particle transport. We derive the energy flows and explore the roles of measurement and time evolution and validate the protocol through quantum circuit simulations on a lattice-regularized NJL model.

However, this material remains paraelectric down to 0K due to the Heisenberg quantum uncertainty principle that prevents atoms from localizing in the ferroelectric minima, a fundamental limit that appears impossible to overcome. This work shows that in the strong out-of-equilibrium regime induced by resonant mid-IR pulses, quantum fluctuations can be suppressed, effectively cooling the material below the 0K ground state and inducing a ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ that is otherwise impossible. The appearance of a metastable state, that is distinct from the conventional ground state, is the first demonstration of how it is possible to leverage and control quantum fluctuations with pulsed light to qualitatively alter the free energy landscape of a quantum system. We predict the conditions and system parameter under which induced non-equilibrium state can be long-lived and even permanent. In providing a quantitative description, based on first principles machine learned potential energy surface, we explain recent experimental observations of light-induced ferroelectric transition in this material.",

    "summary": "In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.   We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.   We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.   We show average-case hardness for the \"standard\" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.",

This suggests that an existing data augmentation technique -- turning the knob to increase error rates in training data -- actually introduces a tradeoff between class imbalance and label noise. We apply this technique in experiments showing robust improvements to decoder accuracy while explaining the failures of this technique in terms of example importance. We show similar improvements for decoding quantum codes involving multiple rounds of syndrome measurements and we characterize example importance in random stabilizer codes, suggesting broad applicability of both example importance and turning the knob for improving experimentally relevant data-driven decoders.",

We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.",

Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model (LVCM). Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its excitation transfer in real time. We continuously drive the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by tuning the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of just one additional vibration reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work also establishes a scalable route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable problems, with neutral atoms emerging as a promising technology. Zoned neutral atom architectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by shielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition to hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software support, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware execution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the effective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead caused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Sub-optimal placements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the subsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement and routing independently thus far - focusing solely on minimizing travel distances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to address this shortcoming. It groups compatible movements into parallel rearrangement steps to minimize both rearrangement steps and travel distances. The implementation utilizing the A* algorithm reduces the rearrangement time by 17% on average and by 49% in the best case compared to the state-of-the-art.

    "summary": "In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.",

Driven open quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen, to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential applications in quantum computation.",

For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.",

    "summary": "To successfully perform quantum computations, it is often necessary to first accurately characterize the noise in the underlying hardware. However, it is well known that fundamental limitations prevent the unique identification of the noise. This raises the question of whether these limitations impact the ability to predict noisy dynamics and mitigate errors. Here, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that when learnable parameters are self-consistently characterized, the unlearnable (gauge) degrees of freedom do not impact predictions of noisy dynamics or error mitigation. We use the recently introduced framework of gate set Pauli noise learning to efficiently and self-consistently characterize and mitigate noise of a complete gate set, including state preparation, measurements, single-qubit gates and multi-qubit entangling Clifford gates. We validate our approach through experiments with up to 92 qubits and show that while the gauge choice does not affect error-mitigated observable values, optimizing it reduces sampling overhead. Our findings address an outstanding issue involving the ambiguities in characterizing and mitigating quantum noise.",

    "summary": "Modern superconducting and semiconducting quantum hardware use external charge and microwave flux drives to both tune and operate devices. However, each external drive is susceptible to low-frequency (e.g., $1/f$) noise that can drastically reduce the decoherence lifetime of the device unless the drive is placed at specific operating points that minimize the sensitivity to fluctuations. We show that operating a qubit in a driven frame using two periodic drives of distinct commensurate frequencies can have advantages over both monochromatically driven frames and static frames with constant offset drives. Employing Floquet theory, we analyze the spectral and lifetime characteristics of a two-level system under weak and strong bichromatic drives, identifying drive-parameter regions with high coherence (sweet spots) and highlighting regions where coherence is limited by additional sensitivity to noise at the drive frequencies (sour spots). We present analytical expressions for quasienergy gaps and dephasing rates, demonstrating that bichromatic driving can alleviate the trade-off between DC and AC noise robustness observed in monochromatic drives. This approach reveals continuous manifolds of doubly dynamical sweet spots, along which drive parameters can be varied without compromising coherence. Our results motivate further study of bichromatic Floquet engineering as a powerful strategy for maintaining tunability in high-coherence quantum systems.",

We propose a quantum generative adversarial network architecture with flexible data encoding and a novel quantum circuit ansatz to effectively model tabular data. The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples. To our knowledge, this is one of the first demonstrations of a successful quantum generative model for handling tabular data, indicating that this task could be well-suited to quantum computers.",

However, this claim critically depends on the choice of classical reference algorithm -- Parallel Tempering with Isoenergetic Cluster Moves (PT-ICM). Here, we reassess these findings with different classical paradigm -- Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM) -- that harnesses nonlinear Hamiltonian dynamics. By leveraging chaotic behavior rather than thermal fluctuations, SBM achieves comparable or superior scaling performance, effectively closing the previously reported quantum-classical gap. We show that small problem sizes analyzed in [1] are insufficient for inferring asymptotic scaling, due to sensitivity to runtime and hardware-specific factors. By extending the benchmark to larger instances -- beyond current quantum annealing capabilities -- we establish strong classical scaling behavior. And as a result, we conclude that it is unlikely that current generation of quantum annealers, can demonstrate supremacy in discrete approximate optimization under operationally meaningful conditions.",

Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entanglement in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters. Furthermore, P2 exhibits superior robustness under realistic imperfections, including diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, as well as dephasing noise. These advantages stem from its ability to suppress the bulk population and minimize susceptibility to decoherence.

To validate this theoretical model, we provide experimental measurements of Raman scattering rates due to near-, and far-detuned lasers for initial states in the metastable D$_{5/2}$ level of $^{137}$Ba$^+$.

An enormous number of problems can be expressed as linear systems of equations, from Machine Learning to fluid dynamics. However, in most cases, HHL will not be able to provide a practical, reasonable solution to these problems. This paper's goal inquires about whether problems can be labeled using Machine Learning classifiers as suitable or unsuitable for HHL implementation when some numerical information about the problem is known beforehand. This work demonstrates that training on significantly representative data distributions is critical to achieve good classifications of the problems based on the numerical properties of the matrix representing the system of equations.

The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.",

This framework provides an easy and convenient way to re-obtain a number of other quantum frameworks like variable time search, quantum divide & conquer and bomb query algorithms. The underlying algorithm is simple, explicitly constructed, and has low poly-logarithmic factors in the complexity.   As a corollary, this gives a quantum algorithm for variable time search with unknown times with optimal query complexity $\\text{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log \\min(n,t_{\\max})})$, where $T = \\sum_i t_i^2$ and $t_{\\max} = \\max_i t_i$ if $t_i$ is the number of steps required to compute the $i$-th variable.

Using quantum Fisher information (QFI), we evaluate the metrological precision of these sensors. For ferromagnetic couplings, weakly connected graphs (e.g., the chain graph, P_4) perform optimally in estimating weak magnetic fields, whereas highly connected graphs (e.g., the complete graph, K_4) excel at strong fields. Conversely, K_4 achieves the highest sensitivity for temperature estimation in the weak-field regime. In the antiferromagnetic case, we uncover a fundamental trade-off dictated by spectral degeneracy: configurations with non-degenerate energy spectra - such as the pan-like graph (three qubits in a triangle with the fourth attached) - exhibit strong magnetic field sensitivity due to their pronounced response to perturbations. In contrast, symmetric structures like the square graph, featuring degenerate energy levels (particularly ground-state degeneracy), are better suited for precise thermometry. Notably, our four-qubit sensors achieve peak precision in the low-temperature, weak-field regime.

We generalize this foundational result to the setting of $\\epsilon$-almost commuting observables, establishing two distinct quantitative approximate Tsirelson's theorems. Both theorems show that if a $d$-dimensional bipartite quantum strategy's observables $\\epsilon$-almost commute, then they are within $O(\\mathrm{poly}(d) \\epsilon)$ (in operator norm) of observables from a genuine tensor product strategy. This provides a quantitative counterpart to the asymptotic result of [N. Ozawa, J. Math. Phys. 54, 032202 (2013)] and justifies the tensor product model as an effective model even when subsystem independence is only approximately satisfied.   Our theorems arise from two different but complementary formulations of almost commutation: (i) The first approach utilizes deterministic operator norm bounds relative to specific matrix generators (such as clock and shift matrices), leading to an approximate Schur's Lemma from which the first theorem directly follows. (ii) The second approach employs probabilistic bounds, requiring small commutators only on average against Haar-random single-qubit unitaries. This method yields two novel probabilistic Stampfli's theorems, quantifying distance to scalars based on probabilistic commutation, a result which may be of independent interest.

    "summary": "Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\\mathbb{Z}_N \\times \\mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\\times 2}, U(1)) / \\left( H^2(G, U(1)) \\right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism.

However, this relation is not valid in general. An alternative universally valid relation was derived by Ozawa in 2003, defining error and disturbance in a general concept, experimentally accessible via a tomographic method. Later, it was shown by Hall that these errors correspond to the statistical deviation between a physical property and its estimate. Recently, it was discovered that these errors can be observed experimentally when weak values are determined through a procedure named \"feedback compensation\". Here, we apply this procedure for the complete experimental characterization of the error-disturbance relation between a which-way observable in an interferometer and another observable associated with the output of the interferometer, confirming the theoretically predicted relation.

In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four qubits.

In this 2-category, 0-morphisms describe anyonic types and Hom-categories describe different models of quantum computing. This picture provides an insightful perspective on superselection rules.

    "summary": "The spontaneous decay of an excited atom by photon emission is one of the most common and elementary physical process present in nature and in laboratories. The decay is random in time with constant probability density, as it can be inferred by the exponential law observed experimentally. Despite the simplicity of the process, in Quantum Mechanics the decay itself is considered a law of nature which is not further analyzed or explained. However it is legitimate to ask for the reason of its randomness and for the dynamics of the atom around the decay. The decay process of an isolated atom is usually assumed to be instantaneous, the so called Quantum jumps. Particular experimental arrangements can widen the duration of the transition from an excited state to the ground state to a finite time. In general this is due to the quantum back action of the detector. The development of Quantum Optics has enormously enriched the possibilities to study in detail the process, and new illuminating insights have been obtained, but the question is still valid and its answer is still elusive. In this paper we analyze the spontaneous decay within the new prospect introduced by a recent model that complete standard Quantum Mechanics in a formalism which is able to describe the dynamics of measurement and of spontaneous decay. Comparison is made with more phenomenological theories, the Quantum Mechanics of open system and the Stochastic wave function model. In the new model the stochastic photon emission by an excited atom is triggered by the vacuum fluctuations. It is suggested how to re-analyze three types of experiments, already realized in many laboratories, in order to reveal the presence and the effect of these fluctuations.",

In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.",

    "summary": "An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system.   Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) are determined by the \"diagonal\" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the \"off-diagonal\" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.",

We support the automation aspect by considering stability and therefore predictability of free parameters and transformation paths.

It utilizes an XXZ Heisenberg chain with an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, considering intrinsic decoherence.

Various decoherence channels are analyzed, showing that the $I$-tangle typically decreases with increased decoherence, except for the generalized W state under phase damping channel, where only one qubit is affected. Interestingly, dark periods of $I$-tangle occur for the GHZ state under non-Markovian dephasing, and while steady-state entanglement disappears in this channel, it remains nonzero when starting from a mixture of GHZ and fully separable states. Additionally, under generalized amplitude damping channel, reduced bipartite states of a W state exhibit entanglement sudden death, while the steady-state $I$-tangle for the spectral decomposed state stays nonzero.",

This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.",

Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection\". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation.

Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation--a defining quantum feature of MQCSs--in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls.

We define a property of the reference, relative measurability, that is sensitive to correlations between the Lab's reference and objects of study. Applying this proposal to analyse the quantum switch (QS), a process widely associated with indefinite causal order, we uncover differences between classical and quantum spacetime realisations of QS, rooted in the relative measurability of the associated references and possibilities for agents' interventions. Our analysis also clarifies a longstanding debate on the interpretation of QS experiments, demonstrating how different conclusions stem from distinct assumptions on the Labs.

The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data.

Attenuated-photon transmission, typically used to simulate single-photon emitters, severely limits the achievable transmission distances and makes the integration of the QKD into existing classical networks, that use tens of thousands of photons per bit of transmission, difficult. Furthermore, it has been found that protocol performance varies with topology. In order to remove the reliance of QKD on single-photon emitters and increase transmission distances, it is worthwhile to explore QKD protocols that do not rely on single-photon transmissions for security, such as the 3-stage QKD protocol, which can tolerate multiple photons in each burst without information leakage. This paper compares and contrasts the 3-stage QKD protocol with conventional QKD protocols and its efficiency in different network topologies and conditions. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical relationship between achievable key rates to increase transmission distances in various topologies.",

    "summary": "Emission and absorption of energy are fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics. The heating induced by driving a many-body system is perhaps the most straightforward diagnostic of the process of equilibration, or the lack thereof. Gapless systems are particularly susceptible to drive-induced heating, and the capacity to control such heating is of experimental importance. Our study addresses this challenge in the framework of conformal field theory (CFT), for which we study families of structured drives up to the aperiodic Thue-Morse sequence. Concretely, we consider a class of spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, where the operator evolution is governed by a non-linear classical dynamical system $\\mathcal{K}$. The existence of invariant regions and fixed points of $\\mathcal{K}$ leads to different levels of ergodicity breaking. Upon bridging the gap between this dynamical system and the driven CFT, we classify various dynamical phases of matter, including the heating and non-heating phases, as well as a prethermal phase with a controllably slow heating rate. We further generalize the discussion to $\\eta-$random multipolar driving, characterized by $\\eta-$th order multipolar correlation in time. A ``triply tunable'' parametric dependence of the prethermal lifetime arises as $K^{-2(\\eta-\\xi)}$, where $K$ quantifies the deviation from the preimages of the fixed points of $\\mathcal{K}$, the multipolar order $\\eta$, and the order of the preimages $\\xi$. Upon sacrificing Hermiticity by considering SU(2) deformed CFTs, we find another non-heating phase with a non-zero measure, inaccessible via purely unitary CFTs. This is underpinned by an emergent compact subspace in the generic $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ group structure, which we also identify in the transfer matrix in non-Hermitian systems with binary disorder.",

    "summary": "(Abridged.) Quantum computers promise to solve some problems exponentially faster than traditional computers, but we still do not fully understand why this is the case. While the most studied model of quantum computation uses qubits, which are the quantum equivalent of a classical bit, an alternative method for building quantum computers is gaining traction. Continuous-variable devices, with their infinite range of measurement outcomes, use systems such as electromagnetic fields. Given this infinite-dimensional structure, combined with the complexities of quantum physics, we are left with a natural question: when are continuous-variable quantum computers more powerful than classical devices? This thesis investigates this question by exploring the boundary of which circuits are classically simulatable and which unlock a quantum advantage over classical computers. A series of proofs are presented demonstrating the efficient simulatability of progressively more complex circuits, even those with high amounts of Wigner negativity. Specifically, circuits initiated with highly Wigner-negative Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which form a grid-like structure in phase space, can be simulated in polynomial time.",

    "summary": "Blind quantum computing (BQC) is a computational paradigm that allows a client with limited quantum capabilities to delegate quantum computations to a more powerful server while keeping both the algorithm and data hidden. However, in practice, existing BQC protocols face significant challenges when scaling to large-scale computations due to photon losses, low efficiencies, and high overheads associated with fault-tolerant operations, requiring the client to compile both logical operations and error correction primitives. We use a recently demonstrated hybrid light-matter approach [PRL 132, 150604 (2024); Science 388, 509-513 (2025)] to develop an architecture for scalable fault-tolerant blind quantum computation. By combining high-fidelity local gates on the server's matter qubits with delegated blind rotations using photons, we construct loss-tolerant delegated gates that enable efficient algorithm compilation strategies and a scalable approach for fault-tolerant blind logical algorithms. Our approach improves the error-correction threshold and increases the speed and depth of blind logical circuits. Finally, we outline how this architecture can be implemented on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, including neutral atom arrays and solid-state spin defects. These new capabilities open up new opportunities for deep circuit blind quantum computing.",

Here, we leverage circuit electrodynamics capabilities of superconducting devices to propose a novel scheme based on a multimode superconducting ring resonator for sensitive probing of TRSB in quantum materials. Our device enables strong nonlinear interactions between the modes and we show that these interactions can lead to highly symmetric configurations which are sensitive to TRSB. Using a driven-dissipative model, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a two-mode superconducting circuit with self- and cross-Kerr nonlinearities under conditions near the bifurcation threshold. When TRSB coupling is introduced, the critical behavior of the system serves as a highly sensitive detection method. Specifically, by mapping out the optimal parameter regimes, we show that even when the photon occupation numbers are subjected to different initial conditions, they can be driven into a symmetric configuration which can be broken even with weak TRSB. Our findings highlight the utility of superconducting microwave resonators other than quantum information processing as a tool for probing exotic states of matter.",

Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\\mathrm{\\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\\mathrm{th}\\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.",

Extending this framework to quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP), where both path information and photon interference are inherently linked to spatial object reconstruction, we establish an imaging duality ellipse (IDE) that directly connects wave-particle duality to the object's transmittance profile. This relation enables object characterization through duality measurements alone and remains robust against experimental imperfections such as decoherence and misalignment.

    "summary": "One-way functions (OWFs) form the foundation of modern cryptography, yet their unconditional existence remains a major open question. In this work, we study this question by exploring its relation to lossy reductions, i.e., reductions~$R$ for which it holds that $I(X;R(X)) \\ll n$ for all distributions~$X$ over inputs of size $n$. Our main result is that either OWFs exist or any lossy reduction for any promise problem~$\\Pi$ runs in time~$2^{\\Omega(\\log\\tau_\\Pi / \\log\\log n)}$, where $\\tau_\\Pi(n)$ is the infimum of the runtime of all (worst-case) solvers of~$\\Pi$ on instances of size~$n$. In fact, our result requires a milder condition, that $R$ is lossy for sparse uniform distributions (which we call mild-lossiness). It also extends to $f$-reductions as long as $f$ is a non-constant permutation-invariant Boolean function, which includes And-, Or-, Maj-, Parity-, Modulo $k$, and Threshold $k$-reductions.   Additionally, we show that worst-case to average-case Karp reductions and randomized encodings are special cases of mildly-lossy reductions and improve the runtime above as $2^{\\Omega(\\log \\tau_\\Pi)}$ when these mappings are considered. Restricting to weak fine-grained OWFs, this runtime can be further improved as~$\\Omega(\\tau_\\Pi)$. Taking~$\\Pi$ as~$kSAT$, our results provide sufficient conditions under which (fine-grained) OWFs exist assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Conversely, if (fine-grained) OWFs do not exist, we obtain impossibilities on instance compressions (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006) and instance randomizations of~$kSAT$ under the ETH.   Finally, we partially extend these findings to the quantum setting; the existence of a pure quantum mildly-lossy reduction for $\\Pi$ within the runtime~$2^{o(\\log\\tau_\\Pi / \\log\\log n)}$ implies the existence of one-way state generators.",

By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and the spin qubit of the NV center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach $10^{-8}$, about five orders of magnitude lower than that in previous works. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.",

    "summary": "Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.",

Our results bridge coherent Bloch dynamics with classical wave control, revealing a versatile experimental platform for exploring quantum-inspired physics. Furthermore, the system exhibits exceptional capabilities for precision transient acoustic field shaping, enabled by high-fidelity pulse-driven modulation.",

    "summary": "Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.",

The interplay of the two, non-Gaussian multimode cluster states, remains challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we propose a framework for the characterization of non-Gaussian cluster states. In analogy to the nowadays frequently used Gaussian nullifiers, we define non-Gaussian nullifiers of cluster states that enable certification of non-Gaussianity in the cluster state.

The transfer tensor method (TTM) has emerged as a powerful and versatile paradigm for such scenarios. It relies on a systematic construction of a converging sequence of time-nonlocal corrections to a time-constant local dynamical map. Here, we show that the same objective can be achieved with time-local extrapolation based on the observation that time-dependent time-local dynamical maps become stationary. Surprisingly, the maps become stationary long before the open quantum system reaches its steady state. Comparing both approaches numerically on examples of the canonical spin-boson model with sub-ohmic, ohmic, and super-ohmic spectral density, respectively, we find that, while both approaches eventually converge with increasing length of short-time propagation, our simple time-local extrapolation invariably converges at least as fast as time-nonlocal extrapolation. These results suggest that, perhaps counter-intuitively, time-nonlocality is not in fact a prerequiste for accurate and efficient long-time extrapolation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.",

By combining time-domain simulations with spectral analysis of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we identify two distinct mechanisms that give rise to localization: geometry-induced subradiance and disorder-induced Anderson-like confinement. Spatially modulated emitter arrangements--such as single- and double-Gaussian transverse profiles--enable long-lived subradiant modes even in the absence of disorder, with decay rates that can be finely controlled via geometric parameters. In contrast, localization in uniform arrays emerges only when disorder breaks spatial symmetry and suppresses collective emission through interference. We track the crossover between geometric and disorder-induced regimes, finding that double-Gaussian profiles exhibit clear spatial signatures of this transition, while single-Gaussian configurations display more gradual changes. These results establish geometry and disorder as complementary tools for engineering long-lived quantum states in waveguide QED systems, with direct relevance for scalable implementations in photonic platforms.",

    "summary": "Quantum metrology enables sensitivity to approach the limits set by fundamental physical laws. Even a single continuous mode offers enhanced precision, with the improvement scaling with its occupation number. Due to their high information capacity, continuous modes allow for the engineering of quantum non-Gaussian states, which not only improve metrological performance but can also be tailored to specific experimental platforms and conditions. Recent advancements in control over continuous platforms operating in the quantum regime have renewed interest in sensing weak forces, also coupling to massive macroscopic objects. In this work, we investigate a force-sensing scheme where a physical process completely randomizes the direction of the induced phase-space displacement, and the unknown force strength is inferred through excitation-number-resolving measurements. We find that $N$-spaced states, where only every $N^{\\text{th}}$ Fock state occupation is nonzero, approach the achievable sensing bound. Additionally, non-Gaussian states are shown to be more resilient against decoherence than their Gaussian counterparts with the same occupation number. While Fock states typically offer the best protection against decoherence, we uncover a transition in the metrological landscape -- revealed through a tailored decoherence-aware Fisher-information-based reward functional -- where experimental constraints favor a family of number-squeezed Schr\\\"odinger cat states. Specifically, by implementing quantum optimal control in a minimal spin-boson system, we identify these states as maximizing force sensitivity under lossy dynamics and finite system controllability.

Each resulting one-dimensional Hamiltonian corresponds to an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with momentum-dependent hoppings and onsite potentials. We introduce a natural rotated basis in which the Hamiltonian becomes planar and the winding number ($\\nu$) is directly computable, providing a clear topological characterization of the reduced model. This framework enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations across the full Brillouin zone. We show that the $\\nu$ exactly reproduces the Chern number of the parent model in the topologically nontrivial phase and allows for an exact characterization of the edge modes. Analytical expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations are derived without requiring perturbative methods. Our analysis further reveals the critical momentum $ k_c $ where edge states traverse the bulk energy gap, and establishes precise conditions for the topological phase transition. In contrast to earlier models, such as plaquette-based tight-binding reductions, our method reveals hidden geometric symmetries in the extended SSH structure that are essential for understanding the topological behavior of systems with long-range hopping.

It is now understood that quantum steering plays a pivotal role in asymmetric quantum information tasks. In this work, we propose a scheme to generate asymmetric steering between two mechanical modes by transferring quantum coherence from a correlated-emission laser. To accomplish this, we derive quantum Langevin equations to describe the optomechanical coupling between two cavity modes and two mechanical modes along with the master equation of two-mode laser. By examining the case where the cavity modes scatter at the anti-Stokes sidebands, we demonstrate that both two-way and one-way steering can be achieved by adjusting the strength of the field driving the gain medium of the laser. Furthermore, we show that the direction of one-way steering can be controlled by varying the temperatures of the mechanical baths or the strengths of the optomechanical couplings. Additionally, we reveal that the directionality of one-way steering depends on the modes fluctuation levels of the modes, with the mode exhibiting larger fluctuations determining the direction. This highly controllable scheme could potentially be realized with current technology, offering a promising platform for implementing one-way quantum information tasks.",

    "summary": "The Barnum-Knill theorem states that the optimal success probability in the multiple state discrimination task is not more than the square root of the success probability when the pretty good or square-root measurement is used for this task. An assumption of the theorem is that the underlying ensemble consists of finitely many quantum states over a finite-dimensional quantum system. Motivated in part by the fact that the success probability is not a relevant metric for continuous ensembles, in this paper we provide a generalization of the notion of pretty good measurement and the Barnum-Knill theorem for general quantum ensembles, including those described by a continuous parameter space and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To achieve this, we also design a general metric of performance for quantum measurements that generalizes the success probability, namely, the expected gain of the measurement with respect to a positive score function. A notable consequence of the main result is that, in a Bayesian estimation task, the mean square error of the generalized pretty good measurement does not exceed twice the optimal mean square error.",

    "summary": "Detector noise is a critical factor in determining the performance of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the trusted detector noise model is widely used to enhance both the secret key rate and transmission distance. This model assumes that noise from the coherent detector is inherently random and cannot be accessed or manipulated by an adversary. Its validity rests on two key assumptions: (1) the detector can be accurately calibrated by the legitimate user and remains isolated from the adversary, and (2) the detector noise is truly random. So far, extensive research has focused on detector calibration and countermeasures against detector side-channel attacks. However, there is no strong evidence supporting assumption (2). In this paper, we analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced Photoreceiver, which has been applied in CV-QKD implementations, and demonstrate that assumption (2) is unjustified. To address this issue, we propose a \"calibrated detector noise\" model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on assumption (1). Numerical simulations comparing different noise models indicate that the new model can achieve a secret key rate comparable to the trusted-noise model, without depending on the questionable assumption of \"truly random\" detector noise.",

Remarkably, this ubiquitous phenomenon can already arise in finite-dimensional systems. However, unlike the bipartite setting, the entanglement of generic multipartite pure states, and specifically their multipartite marginals, is far less understood. Here, we show that sufficiently large marginals of generic multipartite pure states, accounting for approximately half or more of the subsystems, are entangled across all bipartitions. These pure states are thus robust to losses in entanglement distribution and potentially useful for quantum information protocols where the flexibility in the collaboration among subsets of clients is desirable. We further show that these entangled marginals are not only shareable in closed systems, but must also induce entanglement in other marginals when some mild dimension constraints are satisfied, i.e., entanglement transitivity is a generic feature of various many-body closed systems. We further observe numerically that the genericity of (1) entangled marginals, (2) unique global compatibility, and (3) entanglement transitivity may also hold beyond the analytically established dimension constraints, which may be of independent interest.",

In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\\\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.",

In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \\texttt{IBM}'s \\texttt{ibm\\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring.

We focus on distributed quantum storage based on quantum maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. We derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost when the quantum network used for the erasure correction has a star topology. We show that the simple method of downloading the non-erased qudits and performing operations at a single node is optimal when the minimal number of non-erased nodes are accessed. It remains to be seen what the entanglement cost will be when a non-minimal number of non-erased nodes are accessed.

For coherently accessing classical memories of size $2^n$, our protocol consumes only $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ fault-tolerant quantum resources (logical gates, logical qubits, quantum error correction cycles, etc.), avoiding the need to perform active error correction on all $\\Omega(2^n)$ components of the QRAM device. This is the first rigorous conceptual demonstration that a specialized, noisy QRAM device could be useful for implementing a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm. In fact, the fidelity of the device can be as low as $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$. The protocol queries the noisy QRAM device $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ times to prepare a sequence of $n$-qubit QRAM resource states, which are moved to a general-purpose $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-size processor to be encoded into a QEC code, distilled, and fault-tolerantly teleported into the computation. To aid this protocol, we develop a new gate-efficient streaming version of quantum purity amplification that matches the optimal sample complexity in a wide range of parameters and is therefore of independent interest.   The exponential reduction in fault-tolerant quantum resources comes at the expense of an exponential quantity of purely classical complexity: each of the $n$ iterations of the protocol requires adaptively updating the $2^n$-size classical dataset and providing the noisy QRAM device with access to the updated dataset at the next iteration. While our protocol demonstrates that QRAM is more compatible with fault-tolerant quantum computation than previously thought, the need for significant classical computational complexity exposes potentially fundamental limitations to realizing a truly $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-cost fault-tolerant QRAM.",

After encoding $k$ logical qubits into $n>k$ physical qubits using a stabilizer code, this amounts to measuring stabilizers, decoding syndromes, and applying an appropriate correction. Although quantum information can be protected in this way, it is notoriously difficult to manipulate encoded quantum data without introducing uncorrectable errors. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for constructing hardware-tailored quantum circuits that implement any desired Clifford unitary on the logical level of any given stabilizer code. Our main contribution is the formulation of this task as a discrete optimization problem. We can explicitly integrate arbitrary hardware connectivity constraints. As a key feature, our framework naturally incorporates an optimization over all Clifford gauges (differing only in their action outside the code space) of a desired logical circuit. In this way, we find, for example, fault-tolerant and teleportation-free logical Hadamard circuits for the $[[8,3,2]]$ code. From a broader perspective, we turn away from the standard generator decomposition approach and instead focus on the holistic compilation of entire logical circuits, leading to significant savings in practice.

The ferromagnetic ground states of clusters are either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. An interesting consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, these phases are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an a posteriori justification of the assumption on the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point tacitly used in earlier works, and also refine the functional form of its vanishing at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\\tau$ asymptotically as $n(\\tau)\\sim \\ln^{-2}\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\ln^2\\tau}\\right)$.

In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.",

The transfer of geometric phase of the classical pump beam arising from the cyclic evolution of its polarization state on the Poincar\\'e sphere onto the polarization-entangled pair photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Sagnac interferometer enables easy control over the quantum state. Characterization of the generated quantum states reveals that the geometric phase of the pump beam controls the coincidence counts, entanglement visibility, Bell's parameter, quantum state tomography, and fidelity in close agreement with theoretical predictions. We observe sinusoidal modulation of the Bell's parameter and state fidelity with changes in the geometric phase, resulting in transitions between orthogonal Bell states and Bell-like maximally entangled states. Our results establish the geometric phase of the classical pump as a tunable parameter for quantum state control, offering a compact, passive platform for phase manipulation in quantum photonic systems, enabling geometric phase-based quantum gates, and compensating unwanted phase acquired by the quantum state on propagation.",

The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point, but also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit.

In this work, we engineer a locally driven two-qubit Hamiltonian whose instantaneous ground-state dynamics generates the controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gate. In practice, quantum gates have to be implemented in finite-time, hence non-adiabatic and external noise effects debilitate gate fidelities. Here, we show that counterdiabatic control can restore gate performance with near perfect fidelities even in open quantum systems subject to decoherence.",

Human colorectal cancer cells (HT29 line) were labeled with varying concentrations of SPIONs and imaged via a NV center widefield magnetic microscope. To assess the labeling efficacy, a convolutional neural network trained on simulated magnetic dipole data was utilized to reconstruct key labeling parameters on a cell-by-cell basis, including cell diameter, sensor proximity, and the iron mass associated with surface-bound SPIONs.   Our analysis provided quantitative metrics for these parameters across a range of labeling concentrations. The findings indicated that increasing SPION concentration enhances both the cell-surface iron mass and magnetic field strength, demonstrating a saturation effect. This methodology offers a coherent framework for the quantitative, high-throughput characterization of magnetically labeled cells, presenting significant implications for the fields of cell biology and magnetic sensing applications.",

Our purity calculations reveal two high entanglement regimes depending on the initial atomic momentum uncertainty: $1)$ the Recoil entanglement regime (which arises in the small momentum uncertainty region) where recoil effects dominate the mechanisms that originate entanglement, and $2)$ the Doppler entanglement regime (in the large momentum uncertainty region) where homogeneous Doppler shifts in the emitted photon's frequency play the fundamental part in the build up of quantum correlations in the system.

First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to 8 times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state.

Calibration standards are referred to traceable room temperature measurements, while a numerical approach is used to evaluate the artifact response shift from room temperature values, and derive key information to enable full measurement uncertainty budget. Moreover, relevant measurement uncertainty contributions are evaluated according to internationally agreed procedures, and a comprehensive uncertainty budget is presented.

We devise an elegant sum-of-squares (SOS) technique enabling dimension-independent optimization of the quantum violation. Our approach enables the derivation of the state along with the relationship between the local observables directly from the optimization condition. This improves the previous methods of self-testing by deriving the state from the self-testing relation instead of assuming that the state is restricted to a two-qubit system. One significant aspect is the robustness of such self-testing in real experimental situations involving noise and imperfection, leading to deviation from the optimal quantum violation. We provide an analytical technique for robust self-testing in the presence of noise. As an application of our scheme, we demonstrate the generation of two bit DI randomness and analyze the robustness of such randomness.",

Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally.

Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound.

Spinor BECs can be engineered to simulate states that correspond to linear or bent triatomic molecules, with the BEC's Wigner function encoding information about the molecular configuration. We show how quantum simulations of the bending dynamics of linear molecules can be realized, and how the straightening of a bent molecule leads to a dynamical instability. In the dynamics triggered by the corresponding instability, a significant amount of entanglement is generated, and we characterise the dynamics with the squeezing parameter and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The scaling of the non-Gaussian sensitivity, described by the difference between squeezing and QFI, grows with the system size once the spinor system crosses from the linear to the bent phase, thus serving as a dynamical witness for the quantum phase transition.",

The latter is the result of strong electric-dipole interactions of tubulin dimers with ordered-water dipole quanta in the MT interior. We re-interpret the classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\\sigma$-models, describing the emergent dynamics of solitonic excitations in such systems, as representing quantum coherent (or possibly pointer) states, arising from the incomplete collapse of quantum-coherent dipole states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer across the MT networks.

We describe in detail the decision-making process, after the action of an external stimulus, during which optimal path selection for energy-loss-free signal and information transport across the MT network emerges.

This paper presents an alternative scheme that does not rely on applying pulses with short time intervals. Our scheme uses two interacting two-level systems. In the presence of an oscillating field, the interaction strength changes. The oscillating field can be estimated by measuring the change in this interaction strength. We quantify the precision of this estimate by calculating the Fisher information.

We demonstrate that the optimal quantum value exceeds preparation noncontextual bound and, as a result, this establishes DI self-testing of the preparations and the measurement devices. Furthermore, by explicitly constructing the required unitaries, we show that the optimal preparations and measurements in an unknown but finite dimensional Hilbert space, responsible for the observed input-output correlations, can be mapped, via an unitary, onto a known finite-dimensional quantum system.

The experiment tests whether an observer can measure a system without collapsing its wave function.   To this end, we introduce the concept of an unconscious observer, defined by two criteria: (1) It measures a quantum system and sets the state of another system based on the result. (2) It allows an external experimentalist to infer the measurement outcome by examining the observer's state. The more distinguishable the observer's resulting states, the more it resembles a conventional measurement apparatus. Using weak measurements, the experimentalist probes these states, thereby testing the second criterion.   The interference patterns observed in this setup reveal whether collapse has occurred, allowing experimental discrimination between collapse-based and unitary interpretations.",

For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal pre-filtering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of `hot' spin qubits.",

This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols.

However, in magnetic memory applications, the molecules would probably be on a surface at room temperature, and characterizing SMMs under these conditions is challenging and requires specialized techniques. To this end, we use the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, which can function as a highly sensitive sensor of magnetic fields in a broad frequency range at the nanoscale. Here, we utilize single NVs to detect the magnetic noise of cobalt-based SMMs' placed on the diamond surface. We investigated the noise at 296K and at 5-8K, observing a significant influence of the SMMs on the NV center relaxation times at the different temperatures from which we infer their magnetic properties - their magnetic noise spectrum density (NSD). Moreover, we witnessed the effect of an applied magnetic field on the SMMs' magnetic NSD. The method is useful in characterizing SMMs as memory units on surfaces.",

    "summary": "The simplicity of encoding a qubit in the state of a single electron spin and the potential for their integration into industry-standard microchips continue to drive the field of semiconductor-based quantum computing. However, after decades of progress, validating universal logic in these platforms has advanced little beyond first-principles demonstrations of meeting the DiVincenzo criteria. Case in point, and specifically for silicon-based quantum dots, three-qubit algorithms have been the upper limit to date, despite the availability of devices containing more qubits. In this work, we fully exploit the capacity of a spin-qubit array and implement a six qubit quantum circuit, the largest utilizing semiconductor quantum technology. By programming the quantum processor, we execute quantum circuits across all permutations of three, four, five, and six neighbouring qubits, demonstrating successful programmable multi-qubit operation throughout the array. The results reveal that, despite the high quality of individual units, errors quickly accumulate when combining all of them in a quantum circuit. This work highlights the necessity to minimize idling times through simultaneous operations, boost dephasing times, and consistently improve state preparation and measurement fidelities.",

    "summary": "A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to ${S = 3/2, I = 7/2}$, ${S = 1, I = 7/2}$, and ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.",

This formulation not only recovers the well-known results in the Hermitian case but also captures the non-Hermitian effects induced by the time-dependent norm of the state. To validate our theoretical framework, we analyze a single-qubit pseudo-Hermitian system and apply Naimark dilation theory to embed it into an equivalent Hermitian system. The comparison between the original and dilated systems demonstrates the consistency and applicability of the proposed QFI formula in non-Hermitian settings. In addition, we investigate a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system to further explore the influence of non-Hermiticity on QFI.

    "summary": "We study quantum coherence and phase transitions in a finite-size one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using exact numerical diagonalization. The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.",

We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. In our analysis, we show that resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference serve as potent tools for tuning and stabilizing entanglement in structured photonic environments. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photonic bound states induced by bandgap which enables coherent coupling via evanescent fields. The entanglement is preserved for extended times when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel while a novel oscillatory entanglement mechanism emerges from orthogonally aligned atomic dipoles. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. This mechanism exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, including delayed feedback and entanglement revival. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes.",

However, their ability to generate accurate predictions on unseen data, referred to as the predictive performance, remains insufficiently investigated. This study reveals a fundamental limitation in predictive performance when deep encoding layers are employed within the data re-uploading model. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that when processing high-dimensional data with limited-qubit data re-uploading models, their predictive performance progressively degenerates to near random-guessing levels as the number of encoding layers increases. In this context, the repeated data uploading cannot mitigate the performance degradation. These findings are validated through experiments on both synthetic linearly separable datasets and real-world datasets.

The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, that is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces.

Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner.

Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it effectively incorporates nonlocal information, and it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving.

Its physical foundation is the superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent. SDE has hitherto mainly relied on material-specific intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductors, suffering from low yield, controllability, and compatibility with further functional extension - an undesirable aspect for applications. Here, we demonstrated a field-free SDE due to the chemical potential shift from external circuit line resistance, which is generic and challenges the previous interpretations of the intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductivity for zero-field SDE. Moreover, this SDE is circuit-level configurable since it can be electrically switched on/off with its polarity and efficiency precisely modulated via gate voltage and circuit reconfiguration, facilitating functional extension. Such a generic, controllable and extensible SDE addresses critical challenges in dissipationless circuit towards application, and thus establishes a robust platform for scalable superconducting electronics.",

    "summary": "In the past decade, several small-scale quantum key distribution networks have been established. However, the deployment of large-scale quantum networks depends on the development of quantum repeaters, quantum channels, quantum memories, and quantum network protocols. To improve the security of existing networks and adopt currently feasible quantum technologies, the next step is to augment classical networks with quantum devices, properties, and phenomena. To achieve this, we propose a change in the structure of the HTTP protocol such that it can carry both quantum and classical payload. This work lays the foundation for dividing one single network packet into classical and quantum payloads depending on the privacy needs. We implement logistic regression, CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models to classify the privacy label for outgoing communications. This enables reduced utilization of quantum resources allowing for a more efficient secure quantum network design. Experimental results using the proposed methods are presented.",

Generalizing previous approaches, we provide a framework that generates a large class of non-Clifford and non-diagonal logical gates between qudit surface codes by gauging the topological symmetry of symmetry-enriched topological orders. As our main example, we concretely detail a protocol that utilizes the quantum double of $S_3$ to generate a controlled-charge conjugation ($C\\mathcal{C}$) gate between a qubit and qutrit surface code. Both the preparation of non-Abelian states and logical state injection between the Abelian and non-Abelian codes are executed via finite-depth quantum circuits with measurement and feedforward. We discuss aspects of the fault-tolerance of our protocol, presenting insights on how to construct a heralded decoder for the quantum double of $S_3.$ We also outline how analogous protocols can be used to obtain logical gates between qudit surface codes by entangling into $\\mathcal{D}(G),$ where $G$ is a semidirect product of Abelian groups.

    "summary": "Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.",

This construction allows us to conjecture a Liouvillian version of ETH, whereby local superoperators exhibit statistical properties akin to ETH in closed systems. We substantiate our hypothesis using both random Liouvillians and a driven-dissipative quantum spin chain, showing that thermalization manifests through the suppression of coherent oscillations and the emergence of structureless local dynamics.

Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.",

Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds.

LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.",

Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call \"entanglement frustration\". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.",

This work investigates the behavior of the multipartite quantum repeater rate (i.e., the number of GHZ states generated per round and per memory) in the stationary regime in multipartite star graphs with a single central multipartite quantum repeater including multiplexing using Markov chains. We derive a closed-form expression for the stationary rate depending on the network size. We support our results with numerical simulations.

The cost function is evaluated with an extended version of the Bell measurement circuit that can simultaneously measure multiple SB operators and therefore reduces the number of circuits required bythe evaluation process. The proposed VQE scheme is applied to find band-gap energies of metal-halide-perovskite supercells that have finite dimensions with closed boundaries and are described with a sp3 TB model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme gives solutions that follow well the accurate ones, but, more importantly, has the computing efficiency that is obviously superior to the commutativity-based Pauli grouping methods. Extending the application scope of VQE to three-dimensional confined atomic structures, this work can serve as a practical guideline for handling TB simulations in the noise-intermediate-scale quantum devices.",

    "summary": "Mapping quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) circuits with non-trivial connectivity in fixed-layout quantum platforms such as superconducting-based quantum processing units (QPUs) requires a process of transpilation to match the quantum circuit on the given layout. This step is critical for reducing error rates when running on noisy QPUs. Two methodologies that improve the resource required to do such transpilation are the SWAP network and parity twine chains (PTC). These approaches reduce the two-qubit gate count and depth needed to represent fully connected circuits. In this work, a simulated annealing-based method is introduced that reduces the PTC and SWAP network encoding requirements in QAOA circuits with non-fully connected two-qubit gates. This method is benchmarked against various transpilers and demonstrates that, beyond specific connectivity thresholds, it achieves significant reductions in both two-qubit gate count and circuit depth, surpassing the performance of Qiskit transpiler at its highest optimization level. For example, for a 120-qubit QAOA instance with 25% connectivity, our method achieves an 85% reduction in depth and a 28% reduction in two-qubit gates. Finally, the practical impact of PTC encoding is validated by benchmarking QAOA on the ibm_fez device, showing improved performance up to 20 qubits, compared to a 15-qubit limit when using SWAP networks.",

One such non-intuitive phenomenon is phase entanglement, in which the biphoton state is correlated in the complex phase of its wavefunction. This state, which emerges during the propagation of the biphoton wavefunction, exhibits neither position nor momentum correlation, yet retains full entanglement. In this work, we experimentally explore this state in two distinct ways. The first is by tracking the vanishing spatial photon number correlation over propagation distances lying in $\\left[0,\\infty\\right)$, folded into a finite range using single-lens imaging. These observations show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions based on the Double Gaussian (DG) approximation of the biphoton state. The second approach involves performing a two-photon interference experiment using a double slit and this state, which reveals the correlated phase front. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the observed two-photon interference structure is markedly different from that produced by position-correlated photons, as confirmed by computing the joint probability distribution of photons (JPD) and related metrics.

An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'<t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$.

However, most of the prior research on this topic has focused on code capacity noise models. Furthermore, a no-go theorem prevents the construction of CNOT gates for two-level qubits in a bias preserving manner which may, in principle, imply that noise bias cannot be leveraged in such systems. In this work, we show that a residual bias up to $\\eta\\sim$5 can be maintained in CNOT gates under certain conditions. Moreover, we employ controlled-phase (CZ) gates in syndrome extraction circuits and show how to natively implement these in a bias-preserving manner for a broad class of qubit platforms. This motivates the introduction of what we call a hybrid biased-depolarizing (HBD) circuit-level noise model which captures these features. We numerically study the performance of the XZZX surface code and observe that bias-preserving CZ gates are critical for leveraging biased noise. Accounting for the residual bias present in the CNOT gates, we observe an increase in the code threshold up to a $1.27\\%$ physical error rate, representing a $90\\%$ improvement. Additionally, we find that the required qubit footprint can be reduced by up to a $75\\%$ at relevant physical error rates.",

Circuit optimization techniques help mitigate these limitations, enhancing algorithm feasibility. In this work, we implement, optimize, and execute a variational quantum regression algorithm using a novel state preparation method. By leveraging ZX-calculus-based optimization techniques, such as Pauli pushing, phase folding, and Hadamard pushing, we achieve a more efficient circuit design. Our results demonstrate that these optimizations enable the successful execution of the quantum regression algorithm on current hardware. Furthermore, the techniques presented are broadly applicable to other quantum circuits requiring arbitrary real-valued state preparation, advancing the practical implementation of quantum algorithms.",

In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as $\\Delta/\\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient $\\Delta$ as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark.

Integrating this technology into the next generation nuclear systems - designed for universal data collection and real-time sharing as well as cutting-edge instrumentation and increased dependency on digital technologies - could provide significant benefits enabling secure, unattended, and autonomous operation in remote areas, e.g., microreactors and fission batteries. However, any practical implementation on a critical reactor system must meet strict requirements on latency, control system compatibility, stability, and performance under operational transients. Here, we report the complete end-to-end demonstration of a phase-encoding decoy-state BB84 protocol QKD system under prototypic conditions on Purdue's fully digital nuclear reactor, PUR-1. The system was installed in PUR-1 successfully executing real-time encryption and decryption of 2,000 signals over optic fiber distances up to 82 km using OTP-based encryption and up to 140 km with AES-based encryption. For a core of 68 signals, OTP-secure communication was achieved for up to 135 km. The QKD system maintained a stable secret key rate of 320 kbps and a quantum bit error of 3.8% at 54 km. Our results demonstrate that OTP-based encryption introduces minimal latency while the more key-efficient AES and ASCON encryption schemes can significantly increase the number of signals encrypted without latency penalties.

While each route has advanced individually, a unified formulation remains elusive. Recently, consistency between routes (2) and (3) was demonstrated (Nature 637, 314 (2025)). Here, employing combinatorial arguments with Kostka numbers, we establish the microstate uniqueness theorem (MUT). It demonstrates that statistical-mechanics counting constraints (route 1) and symmetric-group-based quantum-mechanical exchange symmetry (a restricted subset of route 2, excluding braid-group generalizations) are mathematically incompatible under indistinguishability. Consequently, intermediate statistics based on higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group or on modified microstate-counting rules are mathematically ruled out for indistinguishable particles.

We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.",

    "summary": "To implement arbitrary quantum circuits in architectures with restricted interactions, one may effectively simulate all-to-all connectivity by routing quantum information. We consider the entanglement dynamics and routing between two regions only connected through an intermediate \"bottleneck\" region with few qubits. In such systems, where the entanglement rate is restricted by a vertex boundary rather than an edge boundary of the underlying interaction graph, existing results such as the small incremental entangling theorem give only a trivial constant lower bound on the routing time (the minimum time to perform an arbitrary permutation). We significantly improve the lower bound on the routing time in systems with a vertex bottleneck. Specifically, for any system with two regions $L, R$ with $N_L, N_R$ qubits, respectively, coupled only through an intermediate region $C$ with $N_C$ qubits, for any $\\delta > 0$ we show a lower bound of $\\Omega(N_R^{1-\\delta}/\\sqrt{N_L}N_C)$ on the Hamiltonian quantum routing time when using piecewise time-independent Hamiltonians, or time-dependent Hamiltonians subject to a smoothness condition. We also prove an upper bound on the average amount of bipartite entanglement between $L$ and $C,R$ that can be generated in time $t$ by such architecture-respecting Hamiltonians in systems constrained by vertex bottlenecks, improving the scaling in the system size from $O(N_L t)$ to $O(\\sqrt{N_L} t)$. As a special case, when applied to the star graph (i.e., one vertex connected to $N$ leaves), we obtain an $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N^{1-\\delta}})$ lower bound on the routing time and on the time to prepare $N/2$ Bell pairs between the vertices. We also show that, in systems of free particles, we can route optimally on the star graph in time $\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ using Hamiltonian quantum routing, obtaining a speed-up over gate-based routing, which takes time $\\Theta(N)$.",

In this paper, we introduce an alternative metric, gate-aware depth, that uses unique gate weights, and investigate how its accuracy in comparing circuit runtimes compares to the existing metrics of traditional and multi-qubit circuit depth. To do so, we compiled a suite of 15 practical circuits using different algorithms and compared depths and runtimes between the compiled versions to determine how accurately the size of the change in depth approximated the size of the change in runtime, and how accurately the order of circuits by depth matched their order by runtime. When approximating the size of runtime changes, gate-aware depth decreased the approximation error by an average of 412 times relative to traditional depth and 124 times relative to multi-qubit depth. When matching the order of true runtimes, gate-aware depth achieved the highest accuracy on all devices and a perfect accuracy of 100% on five out of six devices.

    "summary": "Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) signifies a unique radiation process and provides a promising framework in exploring acceleration radiation in flat/ curved spacetime. Its construction primarily relies on the transition probability of an atom falling through a high-Q cavity while interacting with a quantum field. The HBAR effect has typically been explored in the context of minimal coupling between the atom and the field amplitude. However, the minimally coupled models are affected by the infrared (IR) divergences that arise in the massless limit of the quantum fields in (1+1) dimensions. Thus, in the present manuscript, we examine the HBAR process using both the point-like and finite size detectors coupled with the momentum of the field, which plays a crucial role in naturally resolving IR divergences. Our results suggest that the transition probability for the point-like detector is independent of its frequency. This can be interpreted as the influence of the local gravitational field which modifies the sensitivity of the detector to its frequency and broadens its effective frequency range. Through a comparative study based on the length of the detector, we find that for a detector with a smaller length, the steady state solution for the density matrix of the field vanishes. This may indicate the existence of a non equilibrium thermodynamic state under the condition of finite size detector-field interaction. These distinctive features are exclusive to the derivative coupling between the atom and the field, highlighting them as a compelling subject for future investigation.",

Our program is conceptually different from the decoherence program as well as the quantum-to-classical transition framework with coarse-grained measurements. The path integral formulation provides the joint statistics of a sequence of measurements with each Feynman path picking up an additional random phase due to measurements. The magnitude of this phase is proportional to the measurement strength, and we give conditions under which the dominant contribution to the probability amplitude comes from the trajectories in the vicinity of the classical paths. The proliferation of this information accross the environment, an essential feature of quantum Darwinism, takes place via scattering of plane-wave probes by the system. Extending to repeated measurements, we show that in the continuous limit, each system trajectory picks up an additional phase due to work done by the momentum kicks from the probes - origin of the back-action force. We provide conditions for which the measurement provides sufficient ''which-path\" information and keeps the wave packet sufficiently localized. This allows for description of quantum-to-classical transition at the level of individual trajectories in contrast to the statistical ensemble interpretation provided by density matrices in the decoherence program.",

Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature, while hyperbolic lattices cause it to increase as the system grows - a behavior not seen in ordinary two-dimensional arrays, where the condensation temperature vanishes in the large-size limit. The underlying geometry also controls condensate fluctuations, enhancing them on fractal networks but suppressing them on hyperbolic graphs compared with regular one-dimensional or two-dimensional lattices. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. A multi-site Gutzwiller approach finds a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Re-entrant Mott transitions are seen within a first-order resummed hopping expansion.

    "summary": "We ask whether there exists a relation between controllability of the fluctuations in extractable energy of a quantum battery and (a) how open an arbitrary but fixed battery system is and (b) how large the battery is. We examine three classes of quantum processes for the energy extraction: unitary operations, completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, and arbitrary quantum maps, including physically realizable non-CPTP maps. We show that all three process classes yield the same average extractable energy from a fixed quantum battery. Moreover, open systems are better at controlling fluctuations in fixed quantum batteries: while random unitary operations result in nonzero fluctuation in the extractable energy, the remaining two classes lead to vanishing fluctuations in extractable energy. Furthermore, when the auxiliary system used to implement the non-unitary physically realizable maps is restricted up to a dimension $n$, fluctuation in extractable energy scales as $1/n$ for CPTP maps, outperforming the $\\ln{n}/n$ scaling observed for general quantum maps. Even within open dynamics, therefore, energy extraction via random CPTP maps exhibits greater resilience to fluctuation compared to processes based on arbitrary quantum maps. We subsequently obtain that fluctuations in extractable energy scale as the inverse of the battery's dimension for all three process classes. Unitary maps, therefore, perform - in the sense of as low fluctuation as possible - equally well as more resource-intensive open maps, provided we have access to large quantum batteries. The results underscore a fundamental trade-off between performance of a battery and the resource cost of implementing the extraction processes.",

Investigating the individual effects of these factors on photon indistinguishability is challenging, as both factors affect it simultaneously. In this study, we investigate the temperature-dependent two-photon interference visibility of the biexciton and exciton photons emitted from a single quantum dot under two-photon resonant excitation, while keeping temporal correlation between the paired photons intact.

This generalizes a previous method which only applied to even-dimensional qudits. We believe this protocol to be the most efficient known protocol for Type-II fusion, with the $d=5$ case beating the previous record by a factor of approximately $723$. We discuss the construction of the required $(d-2)$-qudit ancillary state using a silicon spin qudit ancilla coupled to a microwave cavity through time-bin multiplexing. We then introduce a general framework of extra-dimensional corrections, a natural technique in linear optics that can be used to non-deterministically correct non-maximally-entangled projections into Bell measurements.

We demonstrate how this can be circumvented by pairing existing satellite-compatible spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources with qudit-compatible quantum memories on ground. By operating the SPDC source as a source of time-bin encoded photonic qudits, simultaneous distribution of multiple entangled pairs between the ground stations can be achieved at a significantly higher rate than if the SPDC sources was operated as a source of photonic qubits. We find that for achievable coherence times of several seconds and demonstrated satellite performances from the Micius satellite, the qudit operation leads to several orders of magnitude faster distribution rates than the qubit-based operation when more than one event-ready high-quality (Bell pair fidelity $\\geq0.95$) entangled pair is desired.

The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.",

Due to the quadratic form of the total Hamiltonian, the unitary dynamics of the compound system is formally analytically solvable and defines a one-parameter group of Gaussian maps which enables us to solve the exact dynamics of the chain numerically. Following the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) approach to open quantum systems, one can perform the rotating wave approximation with respect to the interacting, or non-interacting chain Hamiltonian and respectively derive the so-called global and local master equations. The solutions of the ensuing different master equations can then be compared with the exact one, possibly sorting out the two approaches in correspondence to different time-scales of the system. We derive the steady states of the open chain quantum dynamics in the two approaches and show that the behaviour of fidelity between them versus inter-oscillator coupling depends on the two bath temperatures, revealing the existence of a temperature-dependent critical inter-oscillator coupling strength that determines the domain of validity of each approach. When the newly found coupling is less than this critical value, the local approach outperforms the global approach, whereas for larger inter-oscillator coupling, the global approach is a better approximation of the exact evolution. This critical value of inter-oscillator coupling depends on the two bath temperatures, which then play a crucial role in deciding the best possible approximating open dynamics.",

    "summary": "While 2-level systems, aka qubits, are a natural choice to perform a logical quantum computation, the situation is less clear at the physical level. Encoding information in higher-dimensional physical systems can indeed provide a first level of redundancy and error correction that simplifies the overall fault-tolerant architecture. A challenge then is to ensure universal control over the encoded qubits. Here, we explore an approach where information is encoded in an irreducible representation of a finite subgroup of $U(2)$ through an inverse quantum Fourier transform. We illustrate this idea by applying it to the real Pauli group $\\langle X, Z\\rangle$ in the bosonic setting. The resulting two-mode Fourier cat code displays good error correction properties and admits an experimentally-friendly universal gate set that we discuss in detail.",

Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.",

The quantum kernel, integrating kernel theory with quantum computing, has attracted widespread attention.

In this paper, we propose quantum multi-view kernel learning with local information, called L-QMVKL. Specifically, based on the multi-kernel learning, a representative method for multi-view data processing, we construct the quantum multi-kernel that combines view-specific quantum kernels to effectively fuse cross-view information. Further leveraging local information to capture intrinsic structural information, we design a sequential training strategy for the quantum circuit parameters and weight coefficients with the use of the hybrid global-local kernel alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of L-QMVKL through comprehensive numerical simulations on the Mfeat dataset, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements achieved through leveraging multi-view methodology and local information.

In specific scenarios, we find that each parameter can be associated with a mode -- the detection mode -- that is proportional to the derivative of either a single non-vacuum mode or the mean-field mode. For a single non-vacuum mode, the correlation between parameters is determined by the real part of the overlap of these detection modes, while in the case of a strong mean-field by the covariance of the quadrature operators of the derivative modes. In both cases, the attainability of the Quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound is determined by the imaginary part of the overlap of the detection modes.

Optimization of large-scale models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity.

We find that while decay events within one module are strongly correlated (over $85\\%$), events in separate modules only display $\\sim 2\\%$ correlations. We also report coincident decay events in the motherboard and in either of the two daughterboard modules, providing further insight into the nature of these decay events. These results suggest that modular architectures, combined with bespoke error correction codes, offer a promising approach for protecting future quantum processors from chip-scale correlated errors.",

    "title": "How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers with less than a million noisy qubits",
    "summary": "Planning the transition to quantum-safe cryptosystems requires understanding the cost of quantum attacks on vulnerable cryptosystems. In Gidney+Eker{\\aa} 2019, I co-published an estimate stating that 2048 bit RSA integers could be factored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. In this paper, I substantially reduce the number of qubits required. I estimate that a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits. I make the same assumptions as in 2019: a square grid of qubits with nearest neighbor connections, a uniform gate error rate of $0.1\\%$, a surface code cycle time of 1 microsecond, and a control system reaction time of $10$ microseconds.   The qubit count reduction comes mainly from using approximate residue arithmetic (Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024), from storing idle logical qubits with yoked surface codes (Gidney+Newman+Brooks+Jones 2023), and from allocating less space to magic state distillation by using magic state cultivation (Gidney+Shutty+Jones 2024). The longer runtime is mainly due to performing more Toffoli gates and using fewer magic state factories compared to Gidney+Eker{\\aa} 2019. That said, I reduce the Toffoli count by over 100x compared to Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024.",

    "summary": "The Hadamard test is naturally suited for the intermediate regime between the current era of noisy quantum devices and complete fault tolerance. Its applications use measurements of the auxiliary qubit to extract information, but disregard the system register completely. Separate advances in classical representations of quantum states via classical shadows allow the implementation of even global classical shadows with shallow circuits. This work combines the Hadamard test on a single auxiliary readout qubit with classical shadows on the remaining $n$-qubit work register. We argue that this combination inherits the best of both worlds and discuss statistical phase estimation as a vignette application. There, we can use the Hadamard test to estimate eigenvalues on the auxiliary qubit, while classical shadows on the remaining $n$ qubits provide access to additional features such as, (i) fidelity with certain pure quantum states, (ii) the initial state's energy and (iii) how pure and how close the initial state is to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Finally, we also discuss how anti-controlled unitaries can further augment this framework.",

We establish an exact mapping between the excitation Hamiltonian of our system and a nonHermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which allows for a completely analytical characterization of its topology. In particular, topological phase transition points separating a topologically trivial and nontrivial regime were identified analytically by the appropriate winding number invariant and the presence of zero energy modes. Similarly to the regular bosonic Kitaev chain, the nonHermitian skin effect and some (but not all) topological edge modes are quickly destroyed at nonzero bosonic onsite potential (harmonic oscillator frequency). Remarkably, however, disorder partially recovers some of these features. This work thus demonstrates the potential of a modified bosonic Kitaev chain as a platform to generate rich nonHermitian topological phenomena from a completely Hermitian system's perspective. Lastly, we suggest a possible experimental realization of the model, which could allow for total control over the parameter space.",

Based on these advances, including dynamically-reconfigurable connectivity and fast transversal operations, we present a low-overhead architecture that supports the layout and resource estimation of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. Utilizing recent advances in fault tolerance with transversal gate operations, this architecture achieves a run time speed-up on the order of the code distance $d$, which we find directly translates to run time improvements of large-scale quantum algorithms. Our architecture consists of functional building blocks of key algorithmic subroutines, including magic state factories, quantum arithmetic units, and quantum look-up tables. These building blocks are implemented using efficient transversal operations, and we design space-time efficient versions of them that minimize interaction distance, thereby reducing atom move times and minimizing the volume for correlated decoding. We further propose models to estimate their logical error performance. We perform resource estimation for a large-scale implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, one of the prototypical benchmarks for large-scale quantum algorithms, finding that 2048-bit RSA factoring can be executed with 19 million qubits in 5.6 days, for 1 ms QEC cycle times.

In this work, we derive bounds on the generalization performance gap between classical RFF models and quantum models for regression and classification tasks with both QNN and quantum kernel architectures.

    "summary": "Variational quantum algorithms have become a standard approach for solving a wide range of problems on near-term quantum computers. Identifying an appropriate ansatz configuration for variational algorithms, however, remains a challenging task, especially when taking into account restrictions imposed by real quantum platforms. This motivated the development of digital-analog quantum circuits, where sequences of quantum gates are alternated with natural Hamiltonian evolutions. A prominent example is the use of the controllable long-range Ising interaction induced in ion-based quantum computers. This interaction has recently been applied to develop an algorithm similar to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), but native to the ion hardware. The performance of this algorithm has demonstrated a strong dependence on the strengths of the individual ion-ion interactions, which serve as ansatz hyperparameters. In this work, we propose a heuristic for identifying a problem-specific ansatz configuration, which enhances the trainability of the ion native digital-analog circuit. The proposed approach is systematically applied to random instances of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian for up to 15 qubits, providing favorable cost landscapes. As the result, the developed approach identifies a well-trainable ion native ansatz, which requires a lower circuit depth to solve specific problems as compared to standard QAOA. This brings the algorithm one step closer to its large scale practical implementation.",

Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\\bar B)$ in the bulk.   Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \\emph{fundamental complement} $\\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$.   We exhibit many examples of $\\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).",

This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior.

In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also \"mix and match\" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube.

We show that this ratio differs from the similarly defined order probability and describe the decoding strategy whose success rate is described by the order probability. We refer to the latter as a probabilistic partition function decoding and show that it is the strategy that at zero temperature corresponds to maximum probability (MP) decoding. Based on the difference between the two decoders, we discuss the possibility of a maximum partition function decodability boundary outside the order-disorder phase boundary. At zero temperature, the difference between the two ratios measures to what degree MP decoding can be improved by accounting for degeneracy among maximum probability errors, through methods such as ensembling. We consider in detail the example of the toric code under bitflip noise, which maps to the Random Bond Ising Model. We demonstrate that estimation of logical performance through decoding probability and order probability is more sample efficient than estimation by counting failures of the corresponding decoders. We consider both uniform noise and noise where qubits are given individual error rates. The latter noise model lifts the degeneracy among maximum probability errors, but we show that ensembling remains useful as long as it also samples less probable errors.",

In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.",

In this work, we investigate the operationally accessible entanglement by employing a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors, each interacting with complementary regions of a quantum field. We derive an upper bound on the entanglement that can be harvested by such detectors and show that it scales as a double logarithm with respect to the UV cutoff-significantly weaker than the single-logarithmic divergence of the standard CFT result.

The state of the two resulting modes is parametrized by the nonlinearity $g$, the relative phase $\\phi$, and a dynamical phase $\\theta$ resulting from the interaction time. The optimal operating point for sensing the relative phase (dynamical phase) is found to be $\\phi = \\pi$ ($\\theta=0$) with quantum Fisher information exhibiting Heisenberg scaling $E^{2}$ (logarithmically modified Heisenberg scaling $\\left({E\\over \\ln E}\\right)^{2}$).

    "summary": "If one wants to establish optimality of a given bipartite entanglement witness, the current standard approach is to check whether it has the spanning property. Although this is not necessary for optimality, it is most often satisfied in practice, and for small enough dimensions or sufficiently structured witnesses this criterion can be checked by hand. In this work we introduce a novel characterization of the spanning property via entanglement-breaking channels, which in turn leads to a new sufficient criterion for optimality. This criterion amounts to just checking the kernel of some bipartite state. It is slightly weaker than the spanning property, but it is a lot easier to test for -- by hand as well as numerically -- and it applies to almost all witnesses which are known to have the spanning property. A second criterion is derived from this, where one can simply compute the expectation value of the given witness on a maximally entangled state. Finally, this approach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive maps.",

Through exactly solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to the underlying topology.

A specially designed qutrit quantum circuit is employed for state preparation, and security is rigorously analyzed through a composable framework using smooth minimum entropy, von Neumann entropy, and Shannon entropy. The protocol achieves optimal key rate in the ideal case and maintains security under significant noise, with a finite-key analysis supporting practical deployment.

We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration, and can be used to calculate diffusion constant. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even such the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite.

Quantum algorithms, notably Grover's algorithm, leverages quantum parallelism to achieve quadratic speedup over classical approaches. Its generalization, the amplitude amplification algorithm, extends this advantage to a broader class of search problems. However, both algorithms are inherently probabilistic and fail to guarantee success with certainty, also they offer no quantum advantage when the initial success probability exceeds 0.5. This work presents a deterministic quantum search algorithm that operates effectively for arbitrary initial success probabilities, providing guaranteed success in searching target states. The proposed approach introduces at most one additional iteration beyond the optimal count required by probabilistic quantum search algorithms. The algorithm preserves the quadratic speedup characteristic of quantum search methods. Additionally, an approach is proposed for the exact search of multiple target states within a bounded number of steps. A complete circuit-level implementation of the proposed algorithm is also presented.",

We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.",

In this work, we present a step-by-step procedure for tuning up a three-site AKC to its sweet spots based on the spectra of a transmon circuit which is integrated with the chain for the purpose of reading out the parity of the chain. The signatures of the transmon's plasma modes in each step, particular those related to the appearance of MBSs in the chain, will be given.

Traditional direct measurement protocols (DMPs), while effective for individual elements, suffer from poor scalability due to post-selection losses and the need for element-specific measurement configurations. In contrast, our method, DMP-ST, leverages random Clifford or biased mutually unbiased basis measurements to enable global estimation: a single dataset suffices to estimate arbitrary off-diagonal entries with high accuracy. We prove that estimating \\(K\\) off-diagonal matrix elements up to additive error \\(\\epsilon\\) requires only \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log K/\\epsilon^2)\\) samples, achieving exponential improvement over conventional DMPs.

However, theoretical studies, which largely employ models with a single cavity mode, cannot explain the experimentally observed kinetic changes. While simplified multimode models with one spatial dimension can capture experimental features involving the polariton states, it is unclear whether they can also describe the dark states. Here, we study the delocalization of dark states for molecules in a multimode cavity, accounting for the three-dimensional nature of experimental setups. Accounting for energetic and orientational disorder, but fixing Rabi splitting and intermolecular distances (i.e., no positional disorder), we find that the delocalization of the dark states scales linearly with the number of molecules in the plane parallel to the cavity mirrors, in contrast to one-dimensional multimode models. Adding layers of molecules along the axis normal to the mirrors increases the delocalization much less. Similar to the one-dimensional models, the dark-state delocalization is enhanced for smaller values of molecular energetic disorder, relative to the light-matter coupling, and cavities with longer longitudinal length. Our work indicates that for certain phenomena, understanding the dark states under strong light-matter coupling might require a proper multimode description of the optical cavity.",

However, its robustness in the presence of perturbations remains a critical question, particularly when sites interact with other lattice sites beyond nearest neighbors.   Our work studies the applicability of schemes designed for 1D chains to topologies with interactions beyond nearest-neighbour. We treat interactions between the next-nearest sites as perturbation of strength $\\varepsilon$ and show that the error in estimation of couplings scales linearly with $\\varepsilon$ in the presence of such interactions. Further, we show that on average, the existence of couplings between sites beyond the next-nearest neighbour results in higher error. We also study the length of the chain that can be estimated (up to a fixed precision) as a function of $\\varepsilon$, in the presence of next-nearest neighbour interactions. Typically, for weak interactions, chains of 40 sites can be estimated within reasonable error. Thus, we study the robustness of estimation scheme designed for a 1D chain when exposed to such multi-site perturbations, offering valuable insights into its applicability and limitations.",

Importantly, we find that the increased quantum Fisher information achieved with non-Gaussian states outweighs their higher energetic cost compared to the Gaussian ground state. We also briefly discuss two photonic non-Gaussian state generation schemes: interaction with an ancillary system and the use of photon number measurement on the photonic probe.",

This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing an exponential advantage over conventional QMC.",

    "summary": "Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.",

Recently, the connection between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm, Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges, including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.",

The first step of the Quantum Search for Extrema and Roots Algorithm (QSERA) is to translate conditions of the form $f(\\mathbf{x}_*) \\simeq f_*$, where $f_*$ is the extremum or zero, to an unstructured search problem for $\\mathbf{x}_*$. This is achieved by mapping $f(\\mathbf{x})$ to a function $u(z)$ to create a quantum oracle, such that $u(z_*) = 1$ and $u(z \\neq z_*) = 0$. The next step is to employ Grover's algorithm to find $z_*$, which offers a quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms. The number of operations needed to map $f(\\mathbf{x})$ to $u(z)$ determines the accuracy of the result and the circuit depth. We describe the implementation of QSERA by assembling a quantum circuit for portfolio optimisation, which can be formulated as a combinatorial problem. QSERA can handle objective functions with higher order terms than the commonly-used Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) framework. Moreover, while QSERA requires some a priori knowledge of the extrema of $f(\\mathbf{x})$, it can still find approximate solutions even if the conditions are not exactly satisfied.",

Here, we propose an entirely new architecture and protocol for their generation based on recurrent quantum photonic neural networks (QPNNs) and focusing on tree-type cluster states. Unlike other approaches, QPNN-based generators are not limited by the the coherence of quantum emitters or by probabilistic multi-photon operations, enabling arbitrary scaling only limited by loss (which, unavoidably, also affects all other methods). We show that a single QPNN can learn to perform all of the many different operations needed to create a cluster state, from photon routing to entanglement generation, all with near-perfect fidelity and at loss-limited rates, even when it is created from imperfect photonic components. Although these losses ultimately place a limit on the size of the cluster states, we show that state-of-the-art photonics should already allow for clusters of 60 photons, which can grow into the 100s with modest improvements to losses. Finally, we present an analysis of a one-way quantum repeater based on these states, determining the requisite platform quality for a global quantum network and highlighting the potential of the QPNN to play a vital role in high-impact quantum technologies.",

The second relaxation, $\\bot$-pseudodeterminism, relaxes the determinism requirement by allowing the output to be a special symbol $\\bot$ on an inverse-polynomial fraction of inputs.   We demonstrate an equivalence between bounded-query logarithmic-size $\\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, logarithmic-size $\\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, and $\\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$.

Numerical benchmarks on short-term memory tasks demonstrate that operating in non-Markovian regimes yields significantly slower memory decay compared to the Markovian limit. Further analyzing the echo-state property (ESP), showing that the non-Markovian quantum reservoir evolves from two different initial states, they do not converge to the same trajectory even after a long time, strongly suggesting that the ESP is effectively violated. Our work provides the first demonstration in quantum reservoir computing that strong non-Markovianity can fundamentally violate the ESP, such that conventional linear-regression readouts fail to deliver stable training and inference.

The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux $\\phi$ introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge $Q$, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic (TM) modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric (TE) ones.

    "summary": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability, classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model, termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and 0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN, QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.",

    "summary": "Advancements in quantum computing pose a significant threat to most of the cryptography currently deployed. Fortunately, cryptographic building blocks to mitigate the threat are already available; mostly based on post-quantum and quantum cryptography, but also on symmetric cryptography techniques. Notably, quantum-safe building blocks must be deployed as soon as possible due to the ``harvest-now decrypt-later'' attack scenario, which is already challenging our sensitive and encrypted data today.   Following an agile defense-in-depth approach, Hybrid Authenticated Key Exchange (HAKE) protocols have recently been gaining significant attention. Such protocols modularly combine conventional, post-quantum, and quantum cryptography to achieve confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees for network channels. Unfortunately, only a few protocols have yet been proposed (mainly Muckle and Muckle+) with different flexibility guarantees.   Looking at available standards in the network domain (especially at the Media Access Control Security (MACsec) standard), we believe that HAKE protocols could already bring strong security benefits to MACsec today. MACsec is a standard designed to secure communication at the data link layer in Ethernet networks by providing security for all traffic between adjacent entities. In addition, MACsec establishes secure channels within a Local Area Network (LAN), ensuring that data remain protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, while operating transparently to higher layer protocols. Currently, MACsec does not offer enough protection in the event of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.   In this work, we tackle the challenge and propose a new versatile HAKE protocol, dubbed VMuckle, which is sufficiently flexible for the use in MACsec to provide LAN participants with hybrid key material ensuring secure communication.",

The two parties, say Alice and Bob, can use the channel to exchange messages -- i.e. to signal. On the other hand, the most general form of causal influence includes also the possibility for Alice, via a local operation on her system, to modify Bob's correlations and viceversa. The presence or absence of these two effects are equivalent, but when they both occur, they can differ in their magnitude.   We study the properties of two functions that quantify the amount of signalling and causal influence conveyed by an arbitrary unitary channel. The functions are proved to be continuous and monotonically increasing with respect to the tensor product of channels. Monotonicity is instead disproved in the case of sequential composition.   Signalling and causal influence are analytically computed for the quantum SWAP and CNOT gates, in the single use scenario, in the $n$-parallel uses scenario, and in the asymptotic regime. A finite gap is found between signalling and causal influence for the quantum CNOT, thus proving the existence of extra causal effects that cannot be explained in terms of communication only. However, the gap disappears in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of parallel uses, leaving room for asymptotic equivalence between signalling and causal influence.",

It is shown that experimental evidence of contextuality can only be obtained when counterfactual gain is observed for a specific combination of blocked path and output port.

Instead, trust is fundamentally a social phenomenon, shaped by how quantum internet is governed, operated, and regulated.

Specifically, for a microwave-optical quantum transducer based on piezo-optomechanics, correlations between the noise affecting the acoustic and electrical modes can lead to substantial noise reduction, thereby enhancing the performance of quantum transduction. This reduction is primarily governed by the phase of the piezo-mechanical coupling and is also influenced by system parameters such as the coupling ratio and mode cooperativities.

We also demonstrate that intensity measurements, commonly used to estimate field energy, can be misleading due to collective effects that suppress or enhance light-matter coupling. To explore further this phenomenon, we analyze a cavity QED model enclosing a single dissipative atom and show that symmetry breaking in the atom-field interaction enables access to the hidden energy stored in dark modes.

Although methods such as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Adiabatic Preparation (AP) offer promising routes, each faces significant challenges. In this work, we introduce a hybrid algorithm that integrates the conceptual strengths of VQAs and AP, enhanced through the use of group-theoretic structures, to efficiently approximate ground and excited states of arbitrary many-body Hamiltonians. Our approach is validated on the one-dimensional XYZ Heisenberg model with periodic boundary conditions across a broad parameters range and system sizes. Given the system size $L$, we successfully prepare up to $L^2-L+2$ of its lowest eigenstates with high fidelity, employing quantum circuit depths that scale only polynomially with L. These results highlight the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm, which offers a compelling pathway for the actual preparation of targeted quantum states on near-term quantum devices.",

    "summary": "Computational entropies provide a framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness under computational constraints. They play a central role in classical cryptography, underpinning the analysis and construction of primitives such as pseudo-random generators, leakage-resilient cryptography, and randomness extractors. In the quantum setting, however, computational analogues of entropy remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate the study of quantum computational entropy by defining quantum computational unpredictability entropy, a natural generalization of classical unpredictability entropy to the quantum setting. Our definition builds on the operational interpretation of quantum min-entropy as the optimal guessing probability, while restricting the adversary to efficient guessing strategies. We prove that this entropy satisfies several fundamental properties, including a leakage chain rule that holds even in the presence of unbounded prior quantum side-information. We also show that unpredictability entropy enables pseudo-randomness extraction against quantum adversaries with bounded computational power. Together, these results lay a foundation for developing cryptographic tools that rely on min-entropy in the quantum computational setting.",

Here we report on experiments in which we used a frequency-multiplexed GBS with $>400$ modes as the reservoir in the quantum-machine-learning approach of quantum reservoir computing. We evaluated the accuracy of our GBS-based reservoir computer on a variety of benchmark tasks, including spoken-vowels classification and MNIST handwritten-digit classification. We found that when the reservoir computer was given access to the correlations between measured modes of the GBS, the achieved accuracies were the same or higher than when it was only given access to the mean photon number in each mode -- and in several cases the advantage in accuracy from using the correlations was greater than 20 percentage points. This provides experimental evidence in support of theoretical predictions that access to correlations enhances the power of quantum reservoir computers. We also tested our reservoir computer when operating the reservoir with various sources of classical rather than squeezed (quantum) light and found that using squeezed light consistently resulted in the highest (or tied highest, for simple tasks) accuracies. Our work experimentally establishes that a GBS can be an effective reservoir for quantum reservoir computing and provides a practical platform for experimentally exploring the role of quantumness and correlations in quantum machine learning at very large system sizes.",

At the second level, it tackles the mapping and routing of qumodes/qubits to implement long-range interactions for the gates decomposed from the first level. Rather than a typical implementation that relies on SWAP primitives similar to qubit-based (or DV-only) systems, we propose an integrated design of connectivity-aware gate synthesis and beamsplitter SWAP insertion tailored for hybrid CV-DV systems. We also introduce an OpenQASM-like domain-specific language (DSL) named CVDV-QASM to represent Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli-exponentials and basic gate sequences from the hybrid CV-DV gate set. Genesis has successfully compiled several important Hamiltonians, including the Bose-Hubbard model, $\\mathbb{Z}_2-$Higgs model, Hubbard-Holstein model, Heisenberg model and Electron-vibration coupling Hamiltonians, which are critical in domains like quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum chemistry.

We map out its phase diagram and for the first time, employ finite-size scaling and Binder cumulants on a quantum annealer to study critical exponents for thermal phase transitions. Our method achieves systematic temperature control by tuning the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, eliminating the need to adjust the physical temperature of the quantum hardware. This work demonstrates how, through fine-tuning and calibration, a quantum annealer can be employed to apply sophisticated finite-size scaling techniques from statistical mechanics.

This approach clarifies the symmetry principles underlying $p$-string condensation and generalizes the familiar connection between anyon condensation and one-form gauging in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models: in field theory, we derive the foliated field theory description of the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ X-Cube model by gauging a higher-form symmetry in stacks of 2+1D $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories; on the lattice, we show how gauging a diagonal 1-form symmetry in isotropic stacks of $G$-graded string-net models leads to string-membrane-nets hosting restricted mobility excitations.

We propose windowed logical observable matching decoders to address the problem of fully efficient decoding: our basic windowed decoder is computationally efficient under the restriction of quiescent (slow) resets. Our two-step windowed decoder can be computationally inefficient but allows fast resets. For both windowed decoders we identify errors which scale sublinearly in $d$ - depending on the structure of the circuit - which can lead to logical failure, and we propose methods to adapt the decoding to remove such failures. Our work highlights the complexity and interest in efficient decoding of fast logic for the surface code.",

Recent advances have shown that by jointly decoding logical qubits in algorithms composed of transversal gates, the number of syndrome extraction rounds can be reduced by a factor of the code distance $d$, at the cost of increased classical decoding complexity. Here, we reformulate the problem of decoding transversal circuits by directly decoding relevant logical operator products as they propagate through the circuit. This procedure transforms the decoding task into one closely resembling that of a single-qubit memory propagating through time. The resulting approach leads to fast decoding and reduced problem size while maintaining high performance. Focusing on the surface code, we prove that this method enables fault-tolerant decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching, and benchmark its performance on example circuits including magic state distillation. We find that the threshold is comparable to that of a single-qubit memory, and that the total decoding run time can be, in fact, less than that of conventional lattice surgery. Our approach enables fast correlated decoding, providing a pathway to directly extend single-qubit QEC techniques to transversal algorithms.",

We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we show that our numerical approach is also applicable for the investigation of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at very long times.",

We then propose three classes of the partitewise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partitewise separable states, respectively.

Our approach achieves \\textit{optimal} total evolution time $\\Theta((\\varepsilon_2-\\varepsilon_1)^{-1})$ for certification under the normalized Frobenius norm, without prior structural assumptions. This approach also extends to certify Hamiltonians with respect to all Pauli norms and normalized Schatten $p$-norms for $1\\leq p\\leq2$ in the one-sided error setting ($\\varepsilon_1=0$). Notably, the result in Pauli $1$-norm suggests a quadratic advantage of our approach over all possible Hamiltonian learning approaches.

We complement our result by showing that the certification problem with respect to normalized Schatten $\\infty$-norm is $\\mathsf{coQMA}$-hard, and therefore unlikely to have efficient solutions. This hardness result provides strong evidence that our focus on the above metrics is not merely a technical choice but a requirement for efficient certification.

While four bands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority (> 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the origin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these transitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on excitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic basis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with the energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon nanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These preliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in nanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and intervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is that predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at most, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two bands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate, depending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the size dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario for the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a single DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests that a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and exciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful.

    "summary": "Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments) to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part of the augmented open-source quantum NLP package lambeq Gen II.",

    "title": "Quantum Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral to advancing natural language processing, used extensively from machine translation to content creation. However, as these models scale to billions of parameters, their resource demands increase dramatically. Meanwhile, quantum computing is recognized for efficiently solving complex problems with quantum characteristics like superposition and entanglement, providing a novel approach to these challenges. This paper attempts to combine quantum computing with LLMs and proposes a Quantum knowledge Distillation algorithm for LLMs (QD-LLM), aimed at reducing the computational and memory overhead required for model loading and inference. Specifically, during the distillation stage, data is fed simultaneously into both the LLMs and the designed quantum student model to initially quantify the difference between their outputs; subsequently, with the help of the true label, the optimization of the quantum student model is executed to minimize the difference with the LLM's output. Throughout this process, only the parameters of the quantum student network are updated to make its output closer to that of the LLMs, thereby achieving the purpose of distillation. Finally, the optimized student model obtained by QD-LLM can efficiently solve domain-specific tasks during inference without the usage of the original LLMs. Experimental results show that, compared to mainstream compression methods, QD-LLM significantly reduces the number of training parameters, memory consumption, training time, and inference time while maintaining performance. Moreover, the optimized student model obtained by QD-LLM surpasses specific models designed for these tasks. We believe that QD-LLM can lay the groundwork for exploring the utilization of quantum computing in model compression and its potential extension to other natural language processing challenges.",

At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis.

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW.

    "summary": "Quantum backflow is a surprising phenomenon in which a quantum particle, moving in one dimension and with a state of rightwards momentum, can exhibit a net probability transfer to the left-hand half-line over a finite time interval. We generalise the setting of quantum backflow to allow for $M$ disjoint time intervals, considering the sum of probability differences for each interval. In classical statistical particle mechanics, the total backflow lies in the interval $[-1,0]$ for all $M$, indicating rightwards probability transfer. By contrast, we show that, in quantum mechanics, the maximum $M$-fold backflow is positive and unbounded from above as $M$ increases, demonstrating that there are states that exhibit repeated periods of backflow.   Moreover, for $M\\ge 2$, we discover a new phenomenon; namely, that there are states whose total backflow is below $-1$, giving a probability transfer to the right-hand half-line beyond that possible in classical statistical particle mechanics. We call this effect \"quantum overflow\". The maximum extent of the backflow and overflow effects is described by a hierarchy of backflow and overflow functions and constants, where the $M$'th backflow (overflow) constant is the supremum (infimum) of the $M$'th backflow (overflow) function. The $M=1$ backflow constant was first identified by Bracken and Melloy.   Our results are obtained by formulating the $M$-fold backflow problem in terms of the spectra of suitable bounded operators. Using this formulation, we also study limiting cases of the backflow and overflow functions, including cases in which two disjoint intervals merge. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical investigations. Among other things, by applying numerical acceleration methods, we obtain a new estimate of the Bracken-Melloy constant of $0.0384506$ which is slightly lower than the previously accepted value of $0.038452$.",

We introduce a geometric framework to derive entropic Leggett-Garg inequalities involving higher-order correlations, and analyze their asymptotic behavior in large-spin systems by employing the WKB approximation. Results show that, for maximally mixed states, quantum violations converge to a constant in the macroscopic limit, rather than growing logarithmically with the system's entropy, indicating that macroscopic realism increasingly dominates as the number of energy levels expands. However, exceptions arise with certain parameter settings, where the semiclassical approximation breaks down entirely, enabling inequalities to exhibit maximal quantum violation, thus revealing that quantum and classical descriptions remain incompatible even on a macroscopic scale. It is noteworthy this violation originates exclusively from the temporal correlations of a single system, distinguishing it from macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in many-body systems such as superconductivity.",

The Ramsey experiments are typically done in optically dilute samples of atoms to improve homogeneity and avoid back-action of atoms on excitation pulses. In contrast to later belief, we predict and experimentally show that in optically thick samples with inhomogeneous broadening of resonant transition, the back-action can lead to the highly enhanced narrowing of Ramsey resonance. The linewidth narrowing and corresponding precision of the frequency measurement scale exponentially with an increase in optical depth of a sample and can reach the limits set by homogeneous broadening.

For the computation of dynamical maps and process tensors, we employ a numerically exact method for non-Markovian open system dynamics based on matrix product operator influence functionals, that can be applied across broad parameter regimes. We find that, with access to single-intervention process tensors, one can generally predict quantum memory in the dynamics at low temperatures. Given instead only the dynamical map, we are still able to detect quantum memory in the case of resonant environments at short evolution times. Moreover, we confirm quantum memory in the stationary dynamical regime using process tensors with the correlated steady state of system and environment as initial condition.",

We propose Physics-Aware Compilation (PAC), a method that improves compilation efficiency while preserving the inherent flexibility of neutral atom systems. PAC introduces physics-aware hardware plane partitioning that strategically allocates hardware resources based on physical device characteristics like AOD and SLM trap properties and qubit mobility constraints. Additionally, it implements parallel quantum circuit division with an improved Kernighan-Lin algorithm that enables simultaneous execution across independent regions while maintaining circuit fidelity. Our experimental evaluation compares PAC with state-of-the-art methods across increasingly larger array sizes ranging from 16x16 to 64x64 qubits. Results demonstrate that PAC achieves up to 78.5x speedup on 16x16 arrays while maintaining comparable circuit quality. PAC's compilation efficiency advantage increases with system scale, demonstrating scalability for practical quantum applications on larger arrays.

For large time scales of the order of two trading years, the anticipated Gaussian behavior of the returns often does not emerge, and their distributions often exhibit a high level of asymmetry and bimodality. These features are inadequately captured by the majority of classical models to address financial time series and return distributions. In the presented analysis, we use a model based on the discrete-time quantum walk to characterize the observed asymmetry and bimodality. The quantum walk distinguishes itself from a classical diffusion process by the occurrence of interference effects, which allows for the generation of bimodal and asymmetric probability distributions. By capturing the broader trends and patterns that emerge over extended periods, this analysis complements traditional short-term models and offers opportunities to more accurately describe the probabilistic structure underlying long-term financial decisions.",

There are serious doubts about the method for generating neutron orbital angular momentum with a crystal interferometer. Due to the extremely different lateral coherence lengths in the interferometer, one should expect the pattern described as a hologram to be asymmetric.

Causal machine learning, or causal inference, aims to solve these issues by estimating the expected outcome of counterfactual events, using observational and/or interventional data, where causal relationships are typically depicted as directed acyclic graphs. It is an open question as to whether these causal algorithms provide opportunities for quantum enhancement. In this paper we consider a recently developed family of non-parametric, continuous causal estimators and derive quantum algorithms for these tasks. Kernel evaluation and large matrix inversion are critical sub-routines of these classical algorithms, which makes them particularly amenable to a quantum treatment. Unlike other quantum machine learning algorithms, closed form solutions for the estimators exist, negating the need for gradient evaluation and variational learning. We describe several new hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and show that uniform consistency of the estimators is retained. Furthermore, if one is satisfied with a quantum state output that is proportional to the true causal estimand, then these algorithms inherit the exponential complexity advantages given by quantum linear system solvers.",

By employing an optimal Bayesian feedback scheme, we achieve unconditional entanglement between the two particles in steady states. More precisely, a Kalman filter is used to estimate the states of the two particles and subsequently a linear quadratic regulator is applied to derive the optimal feedback forces exerted on the particles. Physically, periodic modulation enables significant quantum squeezing in both the common mode and the differential mode of the two particles. The Coulomb coupling between the particles introduces a difference in the squeezing of the two normal modes, thereby facilitating the entanglement of the two levitated particles.

On this basis, we studied a temporal SU(1,1) interferometer based on a temporal Fourier transform system and injected broadband squeezing light into the interferometer for research. The results show that the output spectral characteristics of the interferometer depend on the ratio of the focal group velocity dispersion (GDD) of the two temporal lenses (this ratio is defined as the scaling factor $M$) and the phase derivative of the applied phase. The scaling factor $M$ significantly affects the bandwidth and squeezing degree of the output spectrum. The phase derivative induces a frequency-shift effect, and the magnitude of the shift exhibits a linear relationship to the phase derivative. Furthermore, in the output squeezed-state spectrum, the distribution of squeezing degree concentrates at the center frequency and at positions where frequency shifts occur. As the value of scaling factor $M$ increases, the proportion of squeezing degree allocated at the center frequency correspondingly increases. This temporal SU(1,1) interferometer architecture opens new avenues for the control of non-classical fields in the time-frequency domain and quantum information processing applications.",

While the standard model conserves total spin, Kirton and Keeling \\cite{PhysRevLett.118.123602} demonstrated that even infinitesimal homogeneous local dephasing destroys this phase transition, and that local atomic decay can restore it. We analyze this interplay using degenerate perturbation theory across subspaces of fixed total spin, $S$. For coupling strengths above the threshold, we identify a critical spin value $S_c$ such that the superradiant phase transition occurs only for $S>S_c$. Our perturbative approach captures how weak dephasing and decay induce mixing between different $S$-subspaces, yielding a steady-state spin distribution whose width scales as $1/\\sqrt{N}$. This framework requires only the first and second moments and can be implemented via the 2nd-cumulant approach, circumventing the need for full density matrix calculations. Our results bridge the quantum Rabi model and Dicke physics, elucidate the roles of dephasing and decay in collective quantum effects, and apply broadly to open quantum systems with degenerate steady states.",

Nevertheless, we find that the critical dynamics can still be described by the KZ scaling in which the driving rate has the dimension of $r=z+1/\\nu_\\mu$ with $z$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ being the dynamic exponent and correlation length exponent in this direction, respectively.

However, these protocols are tailored to ideal states, so realistic noise prevents maximal violations and leaves many partially non-local states undetected. Selecting self-tests based on their 'robustness' to noise can tailor protocols to specific applications, but current literature lacks a standardized measure of noise-robustness. Creating such a measure is challenging as there is no operational measure for comparing tests of different dimensionalities and input-output settings. We propose and study three comparative measures: noise-tolerance, convincingness, and an analytic approximation of convincingness called the gapped score. Our computational experiments and analytic framework demonstrate that convincingness provides the most nuanced measure for noise-robustness. We then show that the CHSH game has the highest noise-robustness compared to more complex games (2-CHSH variants and the Magic Square Game) when given equal resources, while with unequal resources, some 2-CHSH variants can outperform CHSH at a high resource cost. This work provides the first systematic and operational framework for comparing noise-robustness in self-testing protocols, laying a foundation for theoretical advances in understanding noise-robustness of self-tests and practical improvements in quantum resource utilization.",

The protocols we suggest enable a comparison among various circuit-based quantum computers, and also between real chips and their noisy simulators. This latter method may then be used to better understand the various types of noise of the real chips.

The quantum component is designed to enhance nonlinear representational capacity while preserving end-to-end differentiability via the PennyLane framework.

We prove that the $L^2$ convergence rate of the lifted process is bounded above by the square root of the spectral gap of its overdamped dynamics, indicating that the lifting approach can at most achieve a transition from diffusive to ballistic mixing speeds. Further, using the variational hypocoercivity framework based on space-time Poincare inequalities, we derive a lower bound for the convergence rate of the lifted dynamics. These findings not only offer quantitative convergence guarantees for hypocoercive quantum Markov processes but also characterize the potential and limitations of accelerating the convergence through lifting. In addition, we develop an abstract lifting framework in the Hilbert space setting applicable to any symmetric contraction $C_0$-semigroup, thereby unifying the treatment of classical and quantum dynamics.

    "summary": "Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.   Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed Schr\\\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.",

    "summary": "We conduct a comparative study to determine the initial quality necessary to extend the distance range of an $N$-qubit GHZ state (the parent state) using two-dimensional repeaters. We analyzed two strategies for distributing initial GHZ states using a centralized quantum switch to determine if any of the strategies show benefits: i) A strategy that employs quantum memories at the switch to retain quantum states entangled with each client node, where memory usage at the switch scales linearly with the number of clients, and ii) A strategy predicated on GHZ measurements at the switch node without reliance on memory assistance. In the former scenario, the switches generate GHZ states and teleport them to the clients by utilizing remote Bell pairs that are asynchronously generated and stored in memory. Conversely, in the latter scenario, the switches perform GHZ projective measurements on freshly generated remote Bell pairs without requiring local storage at the switch. To enhance the distance range of GHZ-type entanglement distribution, we analyze the two approaches as foundational elements for a self-repeating, two-dimensional quantum repeater architecture. Here, the clients of the switch nodes become the 2D repeater nodes that store elementary GHZ states in quantum memories, that can then be fused together to generate long-distance GHZ-type entanglement between end users of the network. By examining the two strategies' entanglement distribution rates and fidelities, we identify the conditions under which the 2D repeater architecture enhances overall performance, and we determine whether either method is a superior building block for such a repeater structure. Our findings illuminate the identification of effective modalities for the long-distance multipartite entanglement distribution within quantum networks.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning, including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.",

For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.",

Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators.

The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.",

Another hallmark of these advances is the ability to observe the time-dependent behaviour of quantum many-body systems. However, the relationship between irregular interaction networks and quantum many-body dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the connection between the structure of the interaction network and the eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model by exploring all possible interaction networks up to seven spins. We find that the eigenstate entanglement depends on the structure of the Hilbert space diagram, particularly the structure of the equienergy subgraph. We further reveal a correlation linking the structure of the Hilbert space diagram to the number of unconstrained spin pairs. Our results demonstrate that the minimum eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model is governed by the specific structure of the interaction network. We anticipate that our findings provide a starting point for exploring quantum many-body systems with arbitrary interactions and finite system size.

Here, we fully solve the problem of competing instabilities of the Fermi surface induced by single-wavelength interactions. We find that while the density-wave (superradiant) instability dominates on the attractive side, it is absent for repulsive interactions, where the competition is instead won by non-superradiant superfluid phases at low temperatures, with Fermion pairs forming at both vanishing and finite center-of-mass momentum. Moreover, even in the absence of such symmetry-breaking instabilities, we find the Fermi surface to be always nontrivially deformed from an isotropic shape.

We show that it is possible to relax the entanglement requirement in quantum teleportation if we have access to a certain strain of superposition of quantum processes. Two types of superposition of quantum processes are generally considered in the literature: superposition of paths identified with quantum maps and superposition of indefinite causal orders of the maps. We find that when superposition of paths is incorporated in the protocol, perfect quantum teleportation becomes possible with nonzero probability, even when the two parties share certain classes of separable states, including pure product states. In contrast, the assistance of superposition of indefinite causal order of quantum maps in teleportation protocol does not enable any quantum advantage for shared pure product states. Furthermore, we show that separable Werner states can also yield quantum advantage in quantum teleportation assisted by the superposition of paths. Finally, we establish that the presence of quantum coherence in the control qubit is both necessary and sufficient to achieve quantum advantage in quantum teleportation assisted with superposition of paths. Our results highlight that while entanglement is a fundamental resource in standard quantum teleportation, superposition of paths can serve as an alternate resource for the same.",

We find that the non-self-averaging regime broadens with the size of the weakly-disordered chain, revealing a nuanced interplay between disorder and system size.

Here we perform \\textit{ab initio} modeling of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centres in hexagonal diamond nanocrystals; for both the neutral and negatively charged species (NV$^0$ and NV$^-$).

There is an additional NV centre where the N and V each have four nearest neighbour carbon atoms. The presence of this latter configuration would provide an unambiguous determination of the hexagonal nature of lonsdaleite. Quantum chemical analysis show all derivatives to be thermochemically stable, and each with their own unique photophysical properties, spectral profiles, and magneto-optical characteristics. By assuming that the ground state properties of the NV$^-$ in hexagonal diamond are comparable to those of NV$^-$ in cubic diamond, albeit with increased strain, we predict ground state fine structure splitting for two of the centres of 2.74~GHz and 4.56~MHz, compared with 2.87~GHz for cubic diamond. The possibility of optically detected magnetic resonance with NV$^-$ in lonsdaleite would provide a new carbon-based quantum sensing system, and an unambiguous method to resolve outstanding issues around the structure of lonsdaleite as hexagonal diamond.",

Quantum computing, with its Hilbert space scaling exponentially with the number of particles, emerges as a promising solution. In this work, we implement a quantum extreme machine learning (QELM) protocol leveraging indistinguishable photon pairs and multimode fiber as a random densly connected layer. We experimentally study QELM performance based on photon coincidences -- for distinguishable and indistinguishable photons -- on an image classification task. Simulations further show that increasing the number of photons reveals a clear quantum advantage. We relate this improved performance to the enhanced dimensionality and expressivity of the feature space, as indicated by the increased rank of the feature matrix in both experiment and simulation.",

Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes.

However, the issue of transferring quantum information across the cores remains unresolved. Quantum Teleportation offers a potential approach for efficient qubit transfer, but existing methods primarily rely on centralized interconnection mechanisms for teleportation, which may limit scalability and parallel communication. We proposes a decentralized framework for teleportation in multi-core quantum computing systems, aiming to address these limitations. We introduce two variants of teleportation within the decentralized framework and evaluate their impact on reducing end-to-end communication delay and quantum circuit depth. Our findings demonstrate that the optimized teleportation strategy, termed two-way teleportation, results in a substantial 40% reduction in end-to-end communication latency for synthetic benchmarks and a 30% reduction for real benchmark applications, and 24% decrease in circuit depth compared to the baseline teleportation strategy. These results highlight the significant potential of decentralized teleportation to improve the performance of large-scale quantum systems, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future quantum architectures.",

    "summary": "Quantum coherence profoundly alters classical thermodynamic expectations by modifying the structure and accessibility of probability distributions. Classically, transitions to lower-entropy states (local second-law violations) are exponentially suppressed, as lower-entropy configurations have fewer available microstates and are statistically improbable. However, introducing quantum coherence and structured quantum interference among semiclassical trajectories significantly changes this scenario. Quantum coherence reduces local entropy by establishing correlations among states that are classically independent, effectively restructuring probability amplitudes to channel transitions toward otherwise improbable low-entropy states. We analyze this phenomenon explicitly within the framework of semiclassical approximations, employing the Van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator to quantify how interference terms arising from coherent superpositions modify classical fluctuation theorems. We demonstrate that quantum coherence, especially when combined with chaos-assisted dynamical tunneling, greatly enhances the probability of transitions to low-entropy configurations, creating pronounced counter-ergodic effects. Furthermore, by considering purification of mixed quantum states, we propose methodologies for deliberately engineering quantum phases among interfering pathways. This phase engineering can explicitly enhance coherence-driven transitions into lower-entropy states, providing a novel thermodynamic resource. Finally, we explore the feasibility of molecular-scale quantum machines exploiting these principles, highlighting their potential applications in quantum thermodynamics and quantum biology for performing useful work through coherence-mediated entropy reduction.",

Our model factors in various sources of error, such as spin decoherence and the finite excited state lifetime. Additionally, we highlight the presence of partial reinitialization of spin coherence with each photon emission, eliminating the hard limitation of coherence time.

However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.",

On the other hand, the approach is based on standard tools from quantum field theory, in particular the path integral and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. After an overview of the conceptual foundations we introduce the modulus-square construction as a formalization of the measurement process for an important class of observables including quadratic observables. We show that this construction has many of the desired properties, including positivity, locality, single measurement recovery and compositionality. We introduce a renormalization scheme for the measurement of quadratic observables that also satisfies compositionality, in contrast to previous renormalization schemes. We discuss relativistic causality, confirming that measurements in our scheme are indeed localized in the spacetime regions where the underlying observables have support.",

While unitary coupled cluster (e.g., UCCSD) has become a standard, the high gate count associated with the implementation of this limits its feasibility on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. K-fold unitary cluster Jastrow (uCJ) ans\\\"atze mitigate this challenge by providing $O(kN^2)$ circuit scaling and favorable linear depth circuit implementation. Previous work has focused on the real orbital-rotation (Re-uCJ) variant of uCJ, which allows an exact (Trotter-free) implementation. Here we extend and generalize the $k$-fold uCJ framework by introducing two new variants, Im-uCJ and g-uCJ, which incorporate imaginary and fully complex orbital rotation operators, respectively. Similar to Re-uCJ, both of the new variants achieve quadratic gate-count scaling. Our results focus on the simplest $k=1$ model, and show that the uCJ models frequently maintain energy errors within chemical accuracy. Both g-uCJ and Im-uCJ are more expressive in terms of capturing electron correlation and are also more accurate than the earlier Re-uCJ ansatz. We further show that Im-uCJ and g-uCJ circuits can also be implemented exactly, without any Trotter decomposition. Numerical tests using $k=1$ on $H_2$, $H_3^+$, $Be_2$, $C_2H_4$, $C_2H_6$ and $C_6H_6$ in various basis sets confirm the practical feasibility of these shallow Jastrow-based ans\\\"atze for applications on near-term quantum hardware.",

This modification removes the constraint on mesh size, making it possible to simulate flows with arbitrary Reynolds numbers. The Chapman-Enskog analysis confirms the modified EDF still recovers the Navier-Stokes equations without compromising collision accuracy. We evaluate the method on 2D and 3D Taylor-Green vortex and lid-driven cavity flows, demonstrating that quantum LKS attains the same accuracy and convergence order as classical LKS.

As a result, LXEB cannot be directly applied to evaluate large-scale quantum devices, which now exceed 100 qubits and continue to grow rapidly in size. To address this limitation, we introduce a constraint known as particle-number conservation into the random quantum circuits used for benchmarking. This restriction significantly reduces the size of the Hilbert space for a fixed particle number, enabling classical simulations of circuits with over 100 qubits when the particle number is $O(1)$.

As a measure of entanglement, we adopt the Entanglement Distance - a quantity derived from the Fubini - Study metric on the system's projective Hilbert space.   We demonstrate that this measure is entirely determined by the vertex degree distribution and remains invariant under vertex relabeling, underscoring its topological nature. Consequently, the entanglement depends solely on the total degree of each vertex, making it insensitive to the distinction between incoming and outgoing edges.   These findings offer a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations and entanglement in complex systems, with promising implications for the design and analysis of quantum networks.",

Here, we propose and analyze a distributed architecture for realizing the (6.6.6) color code. The architecture involves interconnecting patches of the color code housed in different quantum processing units (QPUs) via entangled pairs. To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the color code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on the boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those in the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code under such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a tensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that elevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the tensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no significant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under asymmetric noise conditions. Our findings thus highlight the robustness of color codes in distributed architectures and provide valuable insights into the practical realization of FTQC involving noisy interconnects between QPUs.",

This approach can overcome the limitations of traditional coherent control of scattering caused by non-interfering pathways, known as satellite terms. By tuning the amount of entanglement between reactants, the visibility of coherent control in chemical reactions can be modulated and optimized. Significantly, there exists an optimal amount of entanglement, which ensures complete indistinguishability of the reaction pathways, maximizing the extent of control. This entanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme is computationally illustrated using the ultracold KRb + KRb reaction, where a perfect control over the parity of the product rotational states is achieved.",

Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter.

Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods.

Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density.

However, the number of logical qubits will initially remain limited, posing challenges for resource-intensive tasks like magic state distillation. It is therefore essential to develop efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle rotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these constraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an approach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error mitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded magic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model.

Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can provide a practical advantage which is quantified by a better-than-quadratic improvement in the resource requirements for small-angle rotations over classical simulators.

In this work, we develop a new coding strategy using concatenated continuous variable - discrete variable encodings to go beyond past results and establish GKP's optimal rate over all noise strengths. In particular, for displacement noise, the rate is obtained through a constructive approach by concatenating GKP codes with a quantum polar code and analog decoding.

It is therefore useful to study physical processes which generate entanglement within a large system, as they maybe replicated for applications involving the said requirements in quantum information processing. A possible avenue to maximize entanglement generation is to rely on the phenomena of information scrambling, i.e. transport of initially localized information throughout the system. Here the rationale is that the spread of information carries with it an inherent capacity of entanglement generation. Scrambling greatly depends upon the dynamical nature of the system Hamiltonian, and the interplay between entanglement generation and information scrambling maybe investigated taking a chain of interacting spins on a one dimensional lattice. This system is analogous to an array of qubits and this relative simplicity implies that the resulting unitary dynamics can be efficiently simulated using present-day cloud based NISQ devices. In our present work, we consider such a spin model which is made up of nearest and next nearest neighbor XXZ Model, along with an introduced coupling term lambda. This coupling term serves as a tuning parameter which modifies the dynamical nature of the system from the integrable to the quantum chaotic regime. In order to quantify the entanglement generated within the system we use the more general multipartite metric which computes the average entanglement across all system bipartitions to obtain a global picture of the entanglement structure within the entire system.",

Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point.

In this study, we investigate the impact of basis selection in CS-QST for qudit systems, which are fundamental to high-dimensional quantum information processing. Specifically, we compare the efficiency of the generalized Gell-Mann (GGM) and Heisenberg-Weyl observable (HWO) bases by numerically reconstructing density matrices and evaluating reconstruction accuracy using fidelity and trace distance metrics. Our results demonstrate that, while both bases allow for successful density matrix reconstruction, the HWO basis becomes more efficient as the qudit dimension increases.

Termed the exotic Harmonium model, this provides insights into the electron-PCP correlations, a cornerstone of the emerging field of the ab initio study of multi-component many-body quantum systems. Through a systematic exploration of the parameter space and numerical solutions of the corresponding Schr\\\"odinger equation, we identify two extreme regimes: the atom-like and the particle-in-trap-like behavior. The electron-PCP correlation dominates in the atom-like regime, significantly influencing physical observables, while its role diminishes in the particle-in-trap-like limit. Between these two extremes lies a complex intermediate regime that challenges qualitative interpretation. Overall, the exotic Harmonium model offers a powerful framework to unravel the electron-PCP correlations across diverse systems, spanning particles of varying masses and conditions, from ambient to high-pressure environments.",

The prior work demonstrated that a quantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in simulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many real-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential equations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether quantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we dequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time) dynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this dynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that quantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational complexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we show that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time (exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and polynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time advantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an exponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the complexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations, providing a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.",

In this model, certain forms of correlated randomness are distributed to the participants prior to their computation. The shared randomness is then consumed in a computation phase that involves public communication with efficient round complexity, and the computation is secure in this second phase provided the initial correlations were distributed securely. Usually the latter requires some strong setup assumptions, such as a trusted dealer and private channels. We present a novel approach for generating these correlations from entangled quantum graph states and yield information-theoretic privacy guarantees that hold against a malicious adversary, with limited assumptions. Our primary contribution is a tripartite resource state and measurement-based protocol for extracting a binary multiplication triple, a special form of shared randomness that enables the private multiplication of a bit conjunction. Here, we employ a third party as a Referee and demand only an honest pair among the three parties.

    "summary": "Periodically driven Floquet quantum systems hold great promise for engineering exotic quantum phases and matter, but are often hindered by thermalization. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a square wave modulated Floquet engineering protocol to steer and study thermalization dynamics in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays. We identify a novel reciprocal Floquet thermalization mechanism, which is triggered when combination of laser detuning and the Rydberg atom interaction and Floquet period are reciprocal pairs. This leads to many-body quantum chaos, evidenced by level spacing distribution and inverse participation ratio. Signatures of the thermalization can be found from stroboscopic evolution of the atom population, which saturates to that of the thermal ensemble state. Critically, the thermalization occurs in the disorder-free regime, with rapid equilibration achieved within the Rydberg lifetime and experimentally accessible initial states. Our study establishes a robust framework for manipulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics in many-body interacting spin systems. This approach opens pathways for exploring thermalization-to-localization transitions and designing effective Hamiltonians, and highlight the unique potential of the Rydberg atom array setting for quantum simulation.",

In this work, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a three-level giant atom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide through multiple coupling points and driven by a classical driving field. We derive the analytical expressions for the probability amplitudes of the driven three-level giant atom and obtain two independent conditions. We find two different types of bound states (including the static bound states and the periodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states) and discuss the physical origins of the bound states formation. Moreover, we discuss the case of the driven three-level giant atom interacting with the infinite photonic waveguide, where there is only one purely imaginary solution (i.e., only one bound state condition exists) for its complex frequency (coming from the absence of mirror at one end of the waveguide) compared to that of a driven three-level giant atom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide. With this, we also find two different types of bound states, including the static bound state and the periodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states. Finally, the above results are generalized to a more general model involving a semi-infinite photonic waveguide coupling with an arbitrary number of noninteracting three-level giant atoms driven by the driving fields. The proposed protocol could provide a pathway to precisely elucidate the non-Markovian dynamics of driven, multi-level giant atoms coupled to semi-infinite or infinite photonic waveguides.",

In this work, we provide a systematic, comparative study of static and dynamical indicators of chaos for the closed and open Dicke model. In the closed Dicke model, we find that indicators of chaos sensitive to long-range correlations in the energy spectrum such as the the spectral form factor can deviate from the Poissonian random matrix theory (RMT) predictions and show a dip-ramp-plateau feature even in the normal region of the Dicke model unless very large values of the spin size are chosen. Thus, care is needed in using such indicators of chaos. In the open Dicke model with cavity damping, we find that the dissipative spectral form factor emerges as a robust diagnostic displaying a quadratic dip-ramp-plateau behavior in agreement with the Ginebre Unitary Ensemble (GinUE) RMT in the superradiant regime. Moreover, by examining the spectral properties of the Liouvillian, we provide indirect evidence for the concurrence of the dissipative superradiant quantum phase transition and the change in Liouvillian eigenvalue statistics from 2-D Poissonian to GinUE RMT behavior.",

Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.",

Current state-of-the-art QC use a great quantity of cables to connect the physical qubits, situated in the cryogenic temperature, to room temperature electronics. Integrated cryogenic electronics together with semiconductor spin qubits is one way closer for scalability. Such a scalable quantum computer can have qubits and the control electronics at 4K stage.

This settings-based method, certified by the maximal violation of the multipartite Hardy paradox, achieves a positive key rate and offers a fresh perspective on secure key distribution. Notably, the Hardy paradox enables any two parties to create a secret key with a rate much higher than the N-party key, due to more robust pairwise correlations. This unique capability, inherent to the multipartite Hardy paradox, allows for tailored key distribution within the group, enhancing flexibility. Our work establishes a new paradigm for device-independent conference key agreement, where keys are generated directly from measurement settings using non-maximally entangled states. This approach ensures robust security in untrusted quantum networks and enables pairwise key rates that surpass the N-party rate, offering unprecedented flexibility in key distribution.

Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

    "summary": "Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.",

We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.",

Additionally, we compare the two estimation strategies, examining the behavior of their QCRBs and offering insights into the advantages and limitations of these quantum states in various contexts. Our results show that simultaneous estimation generally outperforms independent estimation, particularly in non-linear protocols. Furthermore, we analyze how the QCRB varies with the coherent state amplitude $|\\alpha|^2$, the number of estimated parameters $d$, and the photon excitation order $n$ across three protocols. The results indicate that increasing $|\\alpha|^2$ and decreasing $d$ improves estimation precision. For low $n$, the variation in the QCRB is similar for both symmetric and antisymmetric cases; however, at higher $n$, the antisymmetric case exhibits slightly better precision. The dependence on $d$ is comparable for both types of states. We also compare PACS-based GHZ states with NOON states and entangled coherent states, demonstrating the relative performance of each.

Therefore, we use operator splitting and construct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity profiles, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate quantum spectral transform plus additional constraints on the Fourier expansion. We evaluate our approach in statevector simulations of a Couette flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation to demonstrate its potential and versatility for scalar mixing in shear flows. The number of gates grows with, at most, the cubed logarithm of the number of grid points.

We establish rigorous convergence bounds towards unitary $k$-designs, revealing the intrinsic cost in terms of non-Clifford resources in various flavors. First, we analyze the $k$-th order frame potential, which quantifies how well the ensemble of doped Clifford circuits is spread within the unitary group. We prove that a quadratic doping level, $t = \\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$, is both necessary and sufficient to approximate the frame potential of the full unitary group. As a consequence, we refine existing upper bounds on the convergence of the ensemble towards state $k$-designs. Second, we derive tight bounds on the convergence of $t$-doped Clifford circuits towards relative-error $k$-designs, showing that $t = \\tilde{\\Theta}(nk)$ is both necessary and sufficient for the ensemble to form a relative $\\varepsilon$-approximate $k$-design. Similarly, $t = \\tilde{\\Theta}(n)$ is required to generate pseudo-random unitaries. All these results highlight that generating random unitaries is extremely costly in terms of non-Clifford resources, and that such ensembles fundamentally lie beyond the classical simulability barrier.

We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.",

    "summary": "Integration of electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has enabled an all-electrical control of atomic and molecular spins on solid surfaces with atomic-scale precision and energy resolution beyond thermal limitations. Further, coherent manipulation and detection of individual spins in an ESR-STM establishes a powerful quantum platform, allowing for the implementation of fundamental quantum logic operations to on-surface identical qubits. In this review, we introduce recent advances of ESR-STM, focusing on its application to atomic-scale qubits and extension to molecular qubit systems. We discuss the principles underlying ESR-STM, followed by single-spin addressability, coherent control via Rabi oscillations, and quantum state readout through frequency-resolved detection. We further demonstrate multi-qubit control architectures enabled by atom manipulation and local magnetic field engineering, culminating in the realization of multi-qubit logic gates such as the Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates. These implementations highlight the specialty of ESR-STM towards atomic-scale quantum circuits. Indeed, ESR-STM can be an excellent tool to perform and evaluate quantum operations in molecular qubits. The results reviewed in this collection establish ESR-STM as a versatile tool for advancing quantum coherent science at the atomic and molecular level in solid-state environments.",

    "summary": "Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is an emerging framework for near-term quantum machine learning that offers in-memory processing, platform versatility across analogue and digital systems, and avoids typical trainability challenges such as barren plateaus and local minima. The exponential number of independent features of quantum reservoirs opens the way to a potential performance improvement compared to classical settings. However, this exponential scaling can be hindered by exponential concentration, where finite-ensemble noise in quantum measurements requires exponentially many samples to extract meaningful outputs, a common issue in quantum machine learning. In this work, we go beyond static quantum machine learning tasks and address concentration in QRC for time-series processing using quantum-scrambling reservoirs. Beyond discussing how concentration effects can constrain QRC performance, we demonstrate that leveraging Hamiltonian symmetries significantly suppresses concentration, enabling robust and scalable QRC implementations. We illustrate our approach with concrete examples, including an established QRC design.",

To address this problem, we propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a moderated gradient version of the $\\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges. Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models.

The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system undergoing coherent evolution and its corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general method for deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.",

Still, the four-local interaction of fermions makes quantum simulation challenging, and it would be good to search for simpler models that keep the essence. In this paper, we argue that the four-local interaction may not be important by introducing a few models that have two-local interactions. The first model is a generalization of the spin-SYK model, which is obtained by replacing the spin variables with SU($d$) generators. Simulations of this class of models might be straightforward on qudit-based quantum devices. We study the case of $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ numerically and observe quantum chaos already for two-local interactions in a wide energy range. We also introduce modifications of spin-SYK and SYK models that have similar structures to the SU($d$) model (e.g., $H=\\sum_{p,q}J_{pq}\\chi_p\\chi_{p+1}\\chi_q\\chi_{q+1}$ instead of the original SYK Hamiltonian $H=\\sum_{p,q,r,s}J_{pqrs}\\chi_p\\chi_q\\chi_r\\chi_{s}$), which shows strongly chaotic features although the interaction is essentially two-local.

We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields do not, in principal, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping, and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.",

What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively.

This {entanglement barrier} restricts classical simulations and, conversely, underpins the quantum advantage anticipated from future devices. Here we show that, for one-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatio-temporal tensor network encoding the evolved wave function amplitudes can be contracted efficiently along the left-right (spatial) direction. Exploiting this structure, we develop a hybrid Tensor-Network/Monte-Carlo (TN-MC) algorithm that samples the wave function and evaluates expectation values of generic local operators with computational cost that scales only polynomially in time. The accurate contraction of the wave function amplitudes is a consequence of the favorable scaling with time of the generalised temporal entropies. We find that their real part either saturates or, at most, grows logarithmically with time, revealing new instances of continuous dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) which we characterize. Our results therefore show that, when computing expectation values of local operators, the entanglement barrier in one-dimensional Hamiltonian evolution can be bypassed with a TN-MC blend.",

When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.",

    "summary": "High-fidelity logical magic states are a critical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling non-Clifford logical operations through state injection. However, benchmarking these states presents significant challenges: one must estimate the infidelity $\\epsilon$ with multiplicative precision, while many quantum error-correcting codes only permit Clifford operations to be implemented fault-tolerantly. Consequently, conventional state tomography requires $\\sim1/\\epsilon^2$ samples, making benchmarking impractical for high-fidelity states. In this work, we show that any benchmarking scheme measuring one copy of the magic state per round necessarily requires $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2)$ samples for single-qubit magic states. We then propose two approaches to overcome this limitation: (i) Bell measurements on two copies of the twirled state and (ii) single-copy schemes leveraging twirled multi-qubit magic states. Both benchmarking schemes utilize measurements with stabilizer states orthogonal to the ideal magic state and we show that $O(1/\\epsilon)$ sample complexity is achieved, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our protocols through numerical simulations under realistic noise models, confirming that their advantage persists even at moderate error rates currently achievable in state-of-the-art experiments.",

To combat errors, pioneering experiments have demonstrated a variety of quantum error correction codes. Yet, most of these codes suffer from low encoding efficiency, and their scalability is hindered by prohibitively high resource overheads. Here, we report the demonstration of two low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, a distance-4 bivariate bicycle code and a distance-3 qLDPC code, on our latest superconducting processor, Kunlun, featuring 32 long-range-coupled transmon qubits. Utilizing a two-dimensional architecture with overlapping long-range couplers, we demonstrate simultaneous measurements of all nonlocal weight-6 stabilizers via the periodic execution of an efficient syndrome extraction circuit. We achieve a logical error rate per logical qubit per cycle of $(8.91 \\pm 0.17)\\%$ for the distance-4 bivariate bicycle code with four logical qubits and $(7.77 \\pm 0.12)\\%$ for the distance-3 qLDPC code with six logical qubits.

We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the energetic separation of substantial but non-quantized Berry fluxes within the topologically trivial bands. Adding a random disorder potential then nudges the system into a stable quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime of the clean system obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window in either of the trivial bands.

In this work, we we introduce a quantifier of complexity of continuous-variable states, e.g. quantum optical states, based on the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. This quantity is built upon two functions of the state: the Wehrl entropy, capturing the spread of the distribution, and the Fisher information with respect to location parameters, which captures the opposite behaviour, i.e. localization in phase space. We analyze the basic properties of the quantifier and illustrate its features by evaluating complexity of Gaussian states and some relevant non-Gaussian states.

Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

For the tensor network approach, we show that its complexity, quantified by entanglement, is governed by the interplay of two other types of quantum resources, coherence and magic. Crucially, which one has the predominant influence on entanglement is elucidated by what we term the time entanglement of $O$. As time entanglement increases, the dominant resource shifts from coherence to magic. Numerical experiments are conducted to support this claim. For the stabilizer formalism approach, we propose an operator stabilizer formalism to enable its application to arbitrary $O$, whose complexity always relies on magic. The operator stabilizer formalism is also powerful than the standard one for simulating some quantum circuits with special structures. Therefore, as the time entanglement increases, the governing resources between the two approaches change from being uncorrelated to highly correlated.",

When the driving strength of single photon tends to infinity, reciprocal coupling fails to obtain any information about the gravitational acceleration, while nonreciprocal coupling still does. Using a two-photon driving, the measurement uncertainty of the gravitational acceleration will tend to zero as the intensity of two-photon driving approaches the critical point. The critical value of the two-photon driving intensity required for nonreciprocal coupling is finite, but the critical value of the two-photon driving intensity required for reciprocal coupling is infinite. The combination of the amplification of mechanical parameters and the extra force can not improve the measurement precision, but it can enhance the susceptibility.

Bohr also emphasized contextuality, the idea that measurement outcomes depend on the broader experimental setup.   Despite his profound insights, Bohr did not offer a formal logical framework for these concepts. We address this gap by generalizing Reichenbach's three-valued logic into a seven-valued, formally contextual system, where contextuality is explicitly encoded via existential quantifiers. This logic retains Reichenbach's indeterminate value while modelling conditional truths across incompatible measurements, resolving key quantum paradoxes without logical inconsistency or nonlocality.   Our approach draws inspiration from Jain logic which embraces multiple, context-dependent truths. Beyond quantum theory, this framework has potential applications in perceptual psychology and cognitive science, where context and contradiction also play central roles.

We demonstrate its effectiveness, using as a case study the source circuit for Hamiltonian simulation to solve a partial differential equation, which is densely populated with multi-controlled gates and is transformed by the state-of-the-art circuit compiler to the target circuit with the quadratic number of CX gates in the number of qubits. MLCO makes visible higher-level circuit structures, providing us with insights about how to simplify the circuits and how to decompose the gates. By putting the right circuit structure in place and selecting the right decomposition algorithm, we could cause massive cancellation of entangling gates, thereby having achieved the quadratic reduction in the number of CX gates.",

    "summary": "Quantum secret sharing is an encryption technique based on quantum mechanics, which utilizes uncertainty principle to achieve security in transmission. Most protocols focus on the study of quantum ($n,n$) or ($t,n$) threshold single secret sharing. In this paper, the first quantum ($t,n$) threshold multi-secret sharing protocol based on Lagrangian interpolation and cluster states is proposed, which requires only $t$ instead of $n$ participants to reconstruct multiple quantum secrets. The protocol exploits the security properties of the cluster state to transmit shared information in two parts, quantum and classical, where the shares remain private after reconstructing quantum secrets. Meanwhile, extending the new measurement basis in cluster states enables participants to transmit quantum information without preparing particles. In the presented protocol, the dealer can be offline after sending secrets. And required quantum operations are all common quantum operations, thus the protocol is practical under the current technical conditions. It is proven to be theoretically secure against external and internal attacks by analyzing the protocol under several common external attacks and internal attacks. In addition, experiments on IMB Q prove that the protocol satisfies correctness and feasibility.",

    "summary": "Rydberg atoms allow for the experimental study of open many-body systems and nonequilibrium phenomena. High dephasing rates are a generic feature of these systems, and therefore they can often be described by rate equations, i.e. in the classical limit. In this work, we analyze one potential origin of the decoherence in Rydberg atoms: dipole-force induced dephasing. As the wave function of the Rydberg (spin-up) state is repelled in the presence of another nearby Rydberg atom, while the ground (spin-down) state diffuses in place, the Franck-Condon overlap between the two spin components quickly decays causing a decoherence of the spin transition. With an analytic approach we obtain a simple expression for the dephasing rate of the Rydberg state depending on atomic and laser parameters, which agrees with numerical findings.",

We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.",

This role reversal provides certain advantages, such as robustness against atomic losses, as the atom remains in its ground state throughout the entire dynamics. This provides higher efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability compared to sources based on the usual JC model under the same parameter conditions in both models. Another advantage of this system is the possibility of direct conversion of a coherent excitation pulse with one photon on average to a single-photon pulse with efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability above $90\\%$. Since the entire excitation pulse is consumed in the generation of a single photon, the system also minimizes energy waste. The potential for implementing the two-photon JC model across different platforms expands the possibilities for controlled single-photon generation in applications in quantum information processing and computation.",

However, the black-box nature of the optimization approaches, such as those used in inverse design in order to minimize a loss function or maximize coupling efficiency, poses challenges in understanding the outputs. This challenge is prevalent in machine learning-based optimization methods, which can suffer from the same lack of transparency. To this end, interpretability techniques address the opacity of optimization models. In this work, we apply interpretability techniques from machine learning, with the aim of gaining understanding of inverse design optimization used in designing photonic components, specifically two-mode multiplexers. We base our methodology on the widespread interpretability technique known as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or LIME. As a result, LIME-informed insights point us to more effective initial conditions, directly improving device performance. This demonstrates that interpretability methods can do more than explain models -- they can actively guide and enhance the inverse-designed photonic components. Our results demonstrate the ability of interpretable techniques to reveal underlying patterns in the inverse design process, leading to the development of better-performing components.",

Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\\rm Tr}(O\\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. ORM achieves this by decomposing the observable $O$ into dichotomic observables and extracting the information of each eigenspace through randomized measurements with block-diagonal unitaries. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and prove its optimality for all Pauli observables, closing a gap in the literature. Furthermore, we develop simplified variants of ORM for local Pauli observables and introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for fidelity estimation, both of which significantly reduce circuit complexities in practical applications. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows.",

To improve on the performance of the logical compilation of the QPE circuits into the Clifford+$T$ gate set, we introduce several partially fault-tolerant (FT) techniques for the Clifford+$R_{Z}$ (arbitrary-angle single-qubit rotation) gate set. To enhance computational fidelity, we integrate Steane QEC gadgets for real-time error correction, demonstrating measurable improvements in precision. The circuits used contain 22 qubits, and up to 2185 physical two-qubit gates and $760$ mid-circuit measurements.

    "summary": "Negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamonds are leading candidates for solid-state quantum memories that can be controlled using electromagnetic or acoustic waves. The latter are particularly promising due to strong strain response of SiV, enabling large spin-phonon interaction strengths. Indeed, coherent spin control via surface acoustic waves (SAW) has been demonstrated and is essential for developing on-chip phononic quantum networks. However, the absence of piezoelectricity in diamond requires interfacing with a piezoelectric material for efficient transduction and delivery of acoustic waves to spins in diamonds. Here, we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated phononic platform that combines thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) with diamond to enable acoustic control of single SiV spins. Additionally, leveraging large SAW-induced strain at the location of SiV, we achieve coherent acoustic control of an electron spin with more than twofold improvement in Rabi frequency compared to the state-of-the-art devices based on aluminum nitride-on-diamond. This work represents a crucial step towards realizing phonon-based quantum information processing systems.",

    "summary": "This work presents a complete geometrical characterisation of divisible and indivisible time-evolution at the level of probabilities for systems with two configurations, open or closed. Our new geometrical construction in the space of stochastic matrices shows the existence of conical bounds separating divisible and indivisible dynamics, bearing analogy with the relativistic causal structure, with an emerging time pointing towards information erasure when the dynamics are divisible. Indivisible dynamics, which include quantum dynamics, are characterised by a time-flow against the information-erasure time coordinate or by being tachyonic with respect to the cones in the stochastic matrix space. This provides a geometric counterpart of other results in the literature, such as the equivalence between information-decreasing and divisible processes. The results apply under minimal assumptions: (i) the system has two configurations, (ii) one can freely ascribe initial probabilities to both and (iii) probabilities at other times are linearly related to the initial ones through conditional probabilities. The optional assumption of (iv) continuity places further constraints on the system, removing one of the past cones. Discontinuous stochastic dynamics in continuous time include cases with divisible blocks of evolution which are not themselves divisible. We show that the connection between continuity and multiplicity of divisors holds for any dimension. We extend methods of coarse graining and dilations by incorporating dynamics and uncertainty, connecting them with divisibility criteria. This is a first step towards a full geometric characterisation of indivisible stochastic dynamics for any number of configurations which, as they cannot at the level of probabilities be reduced to a composition of evolution operators, constitute fundamental elements of probabilistic time-evolution.",

A solution to this problem is to use symmetric gradiometric loops, which incorporate a flux locking mechanism that, once a fluxon is trapped during cooldown, holds the device at the sweet spot and limits the need for active biasing. We demonstrate this technique by simultaneously locking multiple gradiometric fluxonium qubits in which an aluminum loop retains the trapped fluxon indefinitely. By compensating the inductive asymmetry between the two loops of the design, we are able to lock the effective flux-bias within $\\Phi_{eff} = -3 \\times 10^{-4} \\Phi_0$ from the target, corresponding to only 15 % degradation in $T_{2,E}$ when operated in zero external field.

In particular, quantum loss landscapes are often highly non-convex and dominated by poor local minima.

Here, we propose a protocol that uses a targeted noise injection to smooth and regularize quantum loss landscapes. It works by exponentially suppressing the high-frequency components in the Fourier expansion of the quantum loss function. The protocol can be efficiently implemented both in hardware and in simulations. We observe significant and robust improvements of solution quality across various problem types.

For instance, non-local observables are modeled by random Pauli operators, which lead to barren plateaus with probability exponentially close to one. These models are complementary to the conventional deterministic ones, and often simpler to analyze. Using this framework, we show that in the barren plateau regime any two Pauli observables are anti-concentrated with high probability in the following sense. While each of the observables is localized in an exponentially small parameter subspace, these regions are essentially independent, so that their overlap is yet exponentially smaller than each subspace. This invites to rethink the structure of quantum landscapes with barren plateaus and approaches to their optimization, including warm-start strategies.",

A long and narrow yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film strip is etched with an array of transverse groove lines separated by alternating distances, where the second distance is twice the first. This double periodicity in the magnonic crystal translates into dissimilar band gaps in the frequency domain, with the third and sixth band gaps being more pronounced than others. These band gaps are more pronounced because the corresponding wavenumbers simultaneously satisfy the Bragg scattering conditions for the periods equal to the two groove separations as well as their sum. Experimental observations are reproduced by numerical simulations. Together, the experimental and numerical results demonstrate how multiple periodicities could be an effective design parameter for creating magnonic crystals with desired band gaps.",

In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.",

We analyze the impact of individual and multiple fluctuators on a bosonic mode in continuous variable systems, identifying non-Markovian behavior governed by two timescales: the fluctuator switching rate ($\\xi$) and coupling strength ($\\nu$). Using the Breuer-Piilo-Laine (BLP) measure, we show that for Gaussian states, squeezing and thermal fluctuations do not enhance non-Markovianity. In contrast, for non-Gaussian states, the measure becomes unbounded. For rotation-symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, known for their error correction advantages, non-Markovianity grows linearly with code symmetry. We evaluate the performance of RSB codes under simultaneous loss and RTN dephasing. For a teleportation-based Knill error-correction circuit, the codes perform robustly in the Markovian limit. In the non-Markovian regime, the performance depends on the time the error correction is performed for a given codeword. The average gate fidelity of the error-corrected state in this case exhibits oscillations as a function of time due to the oscillatory nature of the dephasing function of the RTN noise; however, for most of the parameter ranges, the values stay above the break-even point. Extending to multiple fluctuators that produce $1/f$ noise, we observe that non-Markovianity decays with increasing fluctuator count, while the performance of RSB codes remains effective with increasing number of fluctuators.",

For a particular case where the random unitary channel is made of just two random unitary operators acting on $d$-dimensional Hilbert-space, we show that the observable with correctable expectation value belongs to a set with at least $d$ parameters.

Using rigorous renormalization techniques, we derive the equations satisfied by the energy eigenvalues in each topology and develop a systematic method to compute spectral shifts. Our results reveal that each topology induces characteristic deviations in the energy spectrum. In the large$-L$ limit ($L >> g_R$), to leading order, the energy eigenvalues for both the $E_1$ and $E_2$ spaces can be written in the unified form $E\\simeq -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mg_R^2}(1 + C_\\Gamma\\,\\frac{2g_R}{L}\\,e^{-L/g_R})$, where the topology dependent coefficient is $C_\\Gamma = 6$ for the $E_1$ space and $C_\\Gamma = 4$ for the $E_2$ space, $g_R$ is the characteristic length scale of the quantum system, and $L$ is the side physical length of the fundamental cubic region.

By modeling the system as a quantum heat engine and solving the master equation under the Born-Markov approximation, we uncover that increasing the number of donors leads to a superlinear enhancement in photocurrent and output power. Specifically, the current does not merely scale linearly with the number of donors but exhibits a marked increase due to collective excitation dynamics and enhanced charge transport. Our results reveal the critical role of donor network topology and aggregation in optimizing quantum photovoltaic efficiency and underscore the potential of biomimetic quantum architectures for next-generation solar energy conversion.",

At the nanoscale, where fluctuations and quantum effects matter, there is no unique thermodynamic framework because thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work depend on the accessibility of the degrees of freedom. We derive a thermodynamic framework for coherently driven systems, where the output light is assumed to be accessible. The resulting second law of thermodynamics is strictly tighter than the conventional one and it demands the output light to be more noisy than the input light. We illustrate our framework across several well-established models and we show how the three-level maser can be understood as an engine that reduces the noise of a coherent drive. Our framework opens a new avenue for investigating the noise properties of driven-dissipative quantum systems.",

We showed that the combination problems of qualities, structures and subjects in panpsychism and panprotopsychism stem from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics regarding supervenience, which are not applicable at the quantum level. Within this view, consciousness arises in entangled quantum systems coupled to the neural network of the brain. In entangled systems, the properties of individual parts disappear, giving rise to an exponential number of emergent properties and states. Here, we analyze self-consciousness as the capacity to view oneself as a subject of experience. The causal openness of quantum systems provides self-conscious beings the ability to make independent choices and decisions, reflecting a sense of self-governance and autonomy. In this context, the issue of personal identity takes a new form free from the problems of the simple view or the reductive approaches.",

Central to this framework is the employment of a two-mode squeezed coherent state, generated via parametric coupling of dual quantized optical fields with collective spin excitations (magnons), serving as the quantum metrological probe. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly reduce quantum noise to levels far below the shot-noise limit. Furthermore, in the non-Markovian case, the per formance of the quantum gyroscope in a dissipative environment does not deteriorate over time, provided that the environmental spectral density satisfies certain conditions.

We show that the latter formulation does not only provide an intuitive derivation of the solution, but it also allows us to understand the diabatic character of quantum evolution in terms of mechanical energy transfers. The sloshing oscillations of the wave function can be then interpreted as the consequence of deviations from the balance between the magnetic force and the gradient of the Bohm potential in the Landau levels.

As a result, the breakdown of the harmonic approximation far from the center limits the cooling performance. Inspired by aberration cancellation in optics, we propose to use compound matter-wave lens systems for $\\delta-$kick cooling with Gaussian potentials. By strategically combining attractive and repulsive kicks, we show that it is possible to mimic the effect of a harmonic potential.

We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks.

However, as the quantum system scales with the problem size, determining the first excited state becomes intractable due to the exponentially increased complexity for large-scale SVP instances. In this paper, we propose a variational quantum Korkin-Zolotarev (VQKZ) algorithm, which significantly reduces the qubit requirement for solving the SVP. Specifically, by transforming the original SVP into a series of subproblems on projected sublattices, the proposed VQKZ algorithm enables near-term quantum devices to solve SVP instances with lattice dimensions 61.39% larger than those solvable by previous methods.

The classical logic description of an optimal quantum algorithm shows that the sheer existence of its quantum speedup logically implies the mutually exclusive or of causal loops. In each of them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future. Then, she can use this knowledge in the best logical way to produce the solution with exactly the number of computation steps of the optimal quantum algorithm. Since the quantum and classical logic descriptions of the quantum algorithm must go along, this tells us that their customary quantum description, which says nothing of the sort, must be incomplete. It is indeed completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the unitary part of the customary quantum description mathematically unaltered but changes the description of the behavior of causality along it. Its single causal process is replaced by the quantum superposition of the causal loops whose mutually exclusive or is logically implied by the sheer existence of the quantum speedup.",

Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method.

As a remedy for this drawback, we introduce a new approach based on one-dimensional (1D) quantum Brownian motion, which exhibits intrinsic unidirectional transport even in the absence of external forces or asymmetric potential gradients, thereby functioning as an effective pseudo-ratchet. Specifically, we exploit that quantum resonance effects in 1D systems divide the momentum space of particles into subspaces. These subspaces have no momentum inversion symmetry, resulting in the natural emergence of unidirectional flow.

Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ Hamiltonian terms into $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of $N$.

We show that measurements using sequences of pulses with alternating phases globally saturates the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound, achieving the theoretical limit of precision for atomic resonance frequency estimation.",

    "summary": "This work presents a scheme for engineering quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering with Gaussian measurements based on the quantum Hopfield model that incorporates a common thermal reservoir. We begin by examining quantum correlations, specifically quantum entanglement and EPR steering, in the ground state. These quantum correlations primarily stem from squeezing interactions in weak and normal strong coupling regimes. As the coupling strength increases, especially upon entering the ultrastrong coupling regime, the correlations emerge from the combined effect of squeezing and mix-mode interactions. Importantly, this scenario enables the realization of two-way EPR steering. Moreover, lower optical frequencies enhance both quantum entanglement and EPR steering. Further, when considering thermal effects, the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes, paired with lower optical frequencies, lead to improved entanglement. The one-way EPR steering for resonant case can be effectively controlled in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes which originates from the asymmetry of subsystem and reservoir coupling induced by the diamagnetic term. Additionally, one-way EPR steering can also be produced for nonresonant case. In this case, the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir originates from the combined effect of nonresonant frequencies and diamagnetic term. Our findings have the potential to inspire further research into quantum information processing that leverages light-matter entanglement and EPR steering.",

This reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature.

As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \\textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model.

Recently, it was shown that by using error mitigation by restricted evolution (EMRE), expectation values of a physical observable can be obtained in constant sampling overhead at the cost of a non-zero bias, which grows as the circuit size or hardware noise increases. To overcome this problem, we introduce the Physics-Inspired Extrapolation (PIE) method, built upon the EMRE framework, to achieve enhanced accuracy and robustness. Unlike traditional zero-noise extrapolation, our method assigns operational interpretation to the parameters in the extrapolation function used in PIE. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on IBMQ hardware and apply it to simulate 84-qubit quantum dynamics efficiently. Our technique yields accurate results with significantly smaller variance, establishing PIE as a practical and scalable error mitigation strategy for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing.",

In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry.

    "summary": "While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude being able to take support in the complex energy plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$ symmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether states are square integrable or not. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two. Our analysis shows that the nonrelativistic square well problem with a real potential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the scattering sector.",

This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported.

Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are called homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\\mathcal{F}$ if for each $F \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Examples of such equivalence relations include isomorphism and cospectrality, as well as equivalence with respect to many formal logics. Quantum groups are a generalisation of topological groups that describe \"non-commutative symmetries\" and, inter alia, have applications in quantum information theory. An important subclass are the easy quantum groups, which enjoy a combinatorial characterisation and have been fully classified by Raum and Weber. A recent connection between these seemingly distant concepts was made by Man\\v{c}inska and Roberson, who showed that quantum isomorphism, a relaxation of classical isomorphism that can be phrased in terms of the quantum symmetric group, is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over the class of planar graphs. We generalise Man\\v{c}inska and Roberson's result to all orthogonal easy quantum groups. We obtain for each orthogonal easy quantum group a graph isomorphism relaxation $\\approx$ and a graph class $\\mathcal{F}$, such that homomorphism indistinguishability over $\\mathcal{F}$ coincides with $\\approx$. Our results include a full classification of the $(0, 0)$-intertwiners of the graph-theoretic quantum group obtained by adding the adjacency matrix of a graph to the intertwiners of an orthogonal easy quantum group.",

    "summary": "In recent work, Nina Emery has defended the view that, in the context of naturalistic metaphysics, one should maintain the same epistemic attitude towards science and metaphysics. That is, naturalists who are scientific realists ought to be realists about metaphysics as well; and naturalists who are antirealists about science should also be antirealists about metaphysics. We call this the `parity thesis'. This paper suggests that the parity thesis is widely, albeit often implicitly, accepted among naturalistically inclined philosophers, and essentially for reasons similar to Emery's. Then, reasons are provided for resisting Emery's specific inference from scientific realism to realism about metaphysics. The resulting picture is a more nuanced view of the relationship between science and metaphysics within the naturalistic setting than the one which is currently most popular.",

However, the reliability of QPT protocols is often compromised by faulty probes, particularly state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which introduce fundamental inconsistencies in traditional QPT algorithms. We propose and investigate enhanced QPT for multi-qubit systems by integrating the error matrix in a digital twin of the identity process matrix, enabling statistical refinement of SPAM error learning and improving QPT precision. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach enables highly accurate and faithful process characterization. We further validate our method experimentally using superconducting quantum gates, achieving at least an order-of-magnitude fidelity improvement over standard QPT.

Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.",

    "summary": "We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible. Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6 qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard 1-shot and few-shot training approaches.",

    "summary": "Dynamical stabilizer codes may offer a practical route to large-scale quantum computation. Such codes are defined by a schedule of error-detecting measurements, which allows for flexibility in their construction. In this work, we ask how best to optimise the measurement schedule of dynamically condensed colour codes in various limits of noise bias. We take a particular focus on the setting where measurements introduce more noise than unitary and idling operations - a noise model relevant to some hardware proposals. For measurement-biased noise models, we improve code performance by strategically repeating measurements within the schedule. For unbiased or $Z$-biased noise models, we find repeating measurements offers little improvement - somewhat contrary to our expectations - and investigate why this is. To perform this analysis, we generalise a metric called the teraquop footprint to the teraquop volume. This is the product of the number of qubits and number of rounds of measurements required such that the probability of a spacelike or timelike logical error occurring is less than $10^{-12}$. In most cases, we find differences in performance are primarily due to the number of rounds of measurements required, rather than the number of qubits - emphasising the importance of using the teraquop volume in the analysis. Additionally, our results provide another example of the importance of making use of correlated errors when decoding, in that using belief matching rather than minimum-weight perfect matching can turn a worst-performing code under a given noise model into a best-performing code.",

In this system, the coupling between the magnon and photon generates the cavity magnon polaritons. When driving the photon-like polariton mode, the bistability can undergo a sudden transition with the increase of the driving power, resulting in an explosive growth of the bistable region by several times. Conversely, driving the magnon-like polariton mode only gives rise to normal bistability. This depends on whether the minimum driving power required to generate the bistability is non-monotonic with respect to the driving frequency. In addition, despite driving only the photon-like polariton mode, the photon- and magnon-like polariton modes can show simultaneous explosive growth of the bistability in microwave transmission, owing to the light-matter interaction. Our research sheds light on the hidden side of the nonlinear cavity magnonic system and provides a potential application for cavity spintronic devices founded on this novel feature.",

This motivates us to study OTOCs in integrable and nonintegrable periodically kicked quantum spin models. A periodically kicked quantum Ising spin system, known as the quantum Ising Floquet system, is a variant of the transverse Ising model. In place of constant transverse magnetic fields in the transverse Ising system, time-periodic fields are applied in the form of delta pulses in the quantum Ising Floquet spin system.

However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free PDTCs in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and depends on the energy density of the initial state, which are two key signatures of PDTCs. The robustness of 1D classical PDTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. The emergence of 1D classical PDTCs can be explained by mapping the 1D classical spin chain with NN interacting to a quantum spin-half system with effective long-range interactions. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order.",

The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.",

These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.",

By employing the effective field theory approach, we model the black hole as a quantum system coupled to an external source via a scalar field, and derive the relation between the decoherence rate and the two-point correlation function of the operators acting on the black quantum system. By utilizing the low-energy Schwarzian effective theory, which captures the boundary dynamics of the $AdS_2$ near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes, we compute the decoherence rate both in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the black hole energy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the decoherence rate compared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble, where the black hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational effects significantly enhance the decoherence rate at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that even in the near-extremal limit where Hawking radiation is suppressed, quantum gravitational fluctuations can strongly influence the coherence of nearby quantum systems.",

Notably, as the number of qubits increases in the mixed W state, its coherence becomes more robust against the degrading effects of Hawking radiation, even as entanglement becomes more fragile. Moreover, with increasing Hawking temperature, W-state coherence surpasses that of the GHZ state, while the entanglement of the W state remains consistently weaker than that of the GHZ state. Interestingly, in Schwarzschild spacetime, fermionic fields exhibit stronger multiqubit entanglement, while bosonic fields show greater multiqubit coherence, revealing a fundamental contrast in their behavior under strong gravity.

    "title": "Beyond Boson Sampling: Higher Spin Sampling as a Practical Path to Quantum Supremacy",
    "summary": "Since the dawn of quantum computation science, a range of quantum algorithms have been proposed, yet few have experimentally demonstrated a definitive quantum advantage. Shor's algorithm, while renowned, has not been realized at a scale to outperform classical methods. In contrast, Fock-state boson sampling has been theoretically established as a means of achieving quantum supremacy. However, most existing experimental realizations of boson sampling to date have been based on Gaussian boson sampling, in which the input states consist of squeezed states of light. In this work, we first introduce spin sampling for arbitrary spin-$S$ states as a practical path to quantum supremacy. We identified a quasi-linear scaling relation between the number of sites $m$ and the number of spins $n$ as $m\\sim n^{1+\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon=3/(2S)$ is inversely proportional to the spin quantum number. This suggests that, within a spin system, an equivalent Fock-state boson sampling task in the linear mode region, characterized by $m\\sim \\Omega(n^{1+\\epsilon})$, is experimentally feasible with reduced resource requirements.",

    "summary": "Oracle quantum programs are a fundamental class of quantum programs that serve as a critical bridge between quantum computing and classical computing. Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.",

    "summary": "Goldstone's theorem and its extension to pseudo-Goldstone (PG) modes have profound implications across diverse areas of physics, from quantum chromodynamics to quantum magnetism. PG modes emerge from accidental degeneracies lifted by quantum and thermal fluctuations, leading to a finite gap--a phenomenon known as \"order by disorder.\" In this paper, we derive a general curvature formula for the PG gap at finite temperature, applicable to both collinear (e.g., ferromagnets and anti-ferromagnets) and noncollinear magnetic orders (e.g., coplanar orders in frustrated magnetic systems). After validating our formula against known models, we apply it to the XXZ model on the triangular lattice, which hosts coplanar magnetic orders in equilibrium and is relevant to materials such as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 and K2Co(SeO3)2, known for their supersolid phases and giant magnetocaloric effects. Our results reveal a distinct scaling behavior: a linear decrease of the PG gap with temperature, driven by entropy effects from magnon scattering across multiple bands. This stands in stark contrast to the high-temperature scaling recently proposed for systems with a single magnon band. This work establishes a general framework for investigating PG modes at finite temperatures and opens an avenue to explore rich quantum phases and dynamics in frustrated systems with noncollinear magnetic orders.",

    "summary": "We investigate the generation of EPR pairs between three observers in a general causally structured setting, where communication occurs via a noisy quantum broadcast channel. The most general quantum codes for this setup take the form of tripartite quantum channels. Since the receivers are constrained by causal ordering, additional temporal relationships naturally emerge between the parties. These causal constraints enforce intrinsic no-signalling conditions on any tripartite operation, ensuring that it constitutes a physically realizable quantum code for a quantum broadcast channel. We analyze these constraints and, more broadly, characterize the most general quantum codes for communication over such channels. We examine the capabilities of codes that are fully no-signalling among the three parties, positive partial transpose (PPT)-preserving, or both, and derive simple semidefinite programs to compute the achievable entanglement fidelity. We then establish a hierarchy of semidefinite programming converse bounds -- both weak and strong -- for the capacity of quantum broadcast channels for EPR pair generation, in both one-shot and asymptotic regimes. Notably, in the special case of a point-to-point channel, our strong converse bound recovers and strengthens existing results. Finally, we demonstrate how the PPT-preserving codes we develop can be leveraged to construct PPT-preserving entanglement combing schemes, and vice versa.",

    "summary": "Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computation, where surface codes demonstrate high fault-tolerant thresholds and hardware efficiency. However, noise in single-shot measurements limits logical readout fidelity, forming a critical bottleneck for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We propose a dynamic measurement scheduling protocol that suppresses logical readout errors by adaptively redistributing measurement tasks from error-prone qubits to stable nodes. Using shallow entangled circuits, the protocol balances gate errors and measurement noise. This is achieved by dynamically prioritizing resource allocation based on topological criticality and error metrics. When addressing realistic scenarios where temporal constraints are governed by decoherence limits and error-correction requirements, we implement reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve adaptive measurement scheduling. Numerical simulations show that logical error rates can be reduced by up to 34% across code distances for 3 to 11, with enhanced robustness in measurement-noise-dominated systems. Our protocol offers a versatile, hardware-efficient solution for high-fidelity quantum error correction, advancing large-scale quantum computing.",

    "summary": "We present an exact spin-elimination technique that reduces the dimensionality of both quadratic and k-local Ising Hamiltonians while preserving their original ground-state configurations. By systematically replacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors, our method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or iterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for hardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly implement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We demonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle larger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without exceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in QAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending the feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory capacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by suppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our spin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order couplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for scaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on near-term hardware. Finally, these results underscore that the next-generation physical spin machines will likely capitalize on k-local spin Hamiltonians to offer an alternative to classical computations.",

Simple postulates are given for physical probability, the only novel one being a locality condition. Translated into no-collapse quantum mechanics, without hidden variables, the postulates imply that the elements in any equiamplitude expansion of the quantum state are equiprobable. Such expansions therefore provide ensembles of microstates that can be used to define probabilities in the manner of frequentism, in von Mises sense (where the probability of P is the frequency of occurrence of P in a suitable ensemble). The result is the Born rule. Since satisfying our postulates, and in particular the locality condition (meaning no action-at-a-distance), these probabilities for no-collapse quantum mechanics are perfectly local, even though they violate Bell inequalities. The latter can be traced to a violation of outcome independence, used to derive the inequalities. But in no-collapse theory that is not a locality condition; it is a criterion for entanglement, not locality.",

    "summary": "Magic states are essential yet resource-intensive components for realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. Preparing magic states within emerging quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes poses additional challenges, due to the complex encoding structures. Here, we introduce a generic and scalable method for magic state injection into arbitrarily selected logical qubits encoded using qLDPC codes. Our approach, based on parallelized code surgery, supports the injection from either physical qubits or low-distance logical qubits. For qLDPC code families with asymptotically constant encoding rates, the method achieves injection into $\\Theta(k)$ logical qubits -- where $k$ denotes the logical qubit number of the code -- with only constant qubit overhead and a time complexity of $\\tilde{O}(d^2)$, where $d$ is the code distance. A central contribution of this work is a rigorous proof that errors affecting the injected magic states remain independent throughout the procedure. This independence ensures the resilience of logical qubits against interactions with noisy ancillae and preserves the presumption of subsequent magic state distillation protocols. We further support our theoretical results with numerical validation through circuit-level simulations. These findings advance the feasibility of scalable, fault-tolerant universal quantum computing using qLDPC codes, offering a pathway to significantly reduced qubit resource requirements in magic state injection.",

    "summary": "Quantum homomorphic encryption is the corresponding technology of classical homomorphic encryption in the quantum field. Due to its ability to ensure the correctness of computation and the security of data, it is particularly suitable for delegated computation in quantum cloud networks. However, previous schemes were unable to simultaneously handle the volatility problem of servers dynamically and eliminate the error caused by homomorphic evaluation of T-gate non-interactively. Therefore, a novel multi-party dynamic quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on rotation operators is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the proposed scheme uses the rotation operators to solve the phase gate error that occurs during the homomorphic evaluation of T-gate non-interactively. Secondly, the scheme can dynamically deal with instability of servers, such as adding a server or removing a server. Then, the trusted key center is introduced, which is responsible for key updating and circuit replacement, which lowers the requirements for quantum capabilities on the client. Finally, this scheme extends the single-client multi-server model to the multi-client multi-server model, making it more suitable for quantum distributed networks and enhancing its practicality. In addition, we theoretically prove the correctness and fully homomorphic property of the proposed scheme, and verify it through the simulation conducted on the IBM Quantum Experience. Security analysis and efficiency analysis further demonstrate that the proposed scheme is information-theoretically secure and possesses high qubit efficiency.",

Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.",

We find a different mechanism for the generation of stable BICs in the open one-dimensional lattice system, which stems from a peculiar dark Floquet state, a state with zero quasi-energy and negligible population on the lossy sites. Our results reveal that the evolutionary stability of BICs resulting from the dark Floquet state can be significantly enhanced, as evidenced by their very low decay rate, by increasing the driving frequency or, counterintuitively, increasing the dissipation strength. We further demonstrate that stable dark Floquet BICs can robustly persist even in nonlinear regimes. The existence of these stable dark Floquet BICs can be attributed to the role of higher-order correction terms in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian derived via the high-frequency expansion (HFE) method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating non-Hermitian dissipation can extend the parameter regime for the existence of BICs, and the dissipation-induced BICs can lead to complete reflection of wave packets. Our findings provide theoretical support for the experimental realization of stable BICs in dissipative quantum systems.",

In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent dissipation rates in quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. Our approach uses time series of observable quantities, such as expectation values of single Pauli operators, as input to learn dissipation profiles without requiring knowledge of the initial quantum state or even the system Hamiltonian.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a hierarchy of open quantum models of increasing complexity, including single-qubit systems with time-independent or time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems (e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes--Cummings model involving light--matter interaction and cavity loss with time-dependent decay rates. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-dependent decay rates from observable time series. To support this, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in all these models are uniquely determined by a finite set of observables, such as qubit and photon measurements. In practice, we combine Transformer-based architectures with lightweight feature extraction techniques to efficiently learn these dynamics. Our results suggest that modern machine learning tools can serve as scalable and data-driven alternatives for identifying unknown environments in open quantum systems.",

By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.",

However, the form of these functions is usually left undetermined. In this work, we investigate the structure of such smooth functions by focusing on their Fourier transform, recently identified as free cumulants. Using non-linear hydrodynamics, we provide a prediction for the late-time behavior of time-ordered free cumulants in the thermodynamic limit. The prediction is further corroborated by large-scale numerical simulations of a non-integrable spin-$1$ Ising model, which exhibits diffusive transport behavior.

This system features five excitation modes: cavity-1 photons, atomic ensemble, cavity-2 photons, the magnon, and phonon modes of the YIG sphere. Thus various combinations of bipartite entanglements can be studied. Our main focus is the study of various combinations of distant bipartite entanglements, especially the entanglement of the atomic ensemble and photons in cavity-1 with the magnon and phonon modes of the YIG sphere in cavity-2. Compared to the previously reported results, introducing a CFL significantly enhances all the bipartite entanglements. Besides, the degree of entanglement of various modes, the parameters space, where the strong entanglement exists, is also significantly enhanced due to CFL. Moreover, the entanglement is more robust against thermal noise. We believe our results are important for quantum technologies where the distribution of entanglement on quantum networks is crucial.",

In particular, we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Therefore, entanglement becomes a key component of the optimization (training) process. We believe that, by leveraging prior knowledge of the entangling power of unitaries, the proposed quantum-classical framework can guide and help to design better-parameterized quantum circuits for various real-world applications.",

    "summary": "Absolutely maximally entangled states are quantum states that exhibit maximal entanglement across any bipartition, making them valuable for applications. This study investigates the behavior of qubit AME states under the influence of noisy quantum channels. Our results demonstrate that for certain channels, such as the depolarizing channel, the entanglement properties remain invariant under local unitary transformations and are independent of the choice of qubits in each subset. However, for channels like the dephasing channel, the entanglement behavior can vary depending on the specific AME state and the choice of qubits, revealing a symmetry-breaking effect. These findings highlight the nuanced relationship between AME states and noise, providing insights into their robustness and potential applications in noisy quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Fault-tolerant quantum computers are expected to be offered as cloud services due to their significant resource and infrastructure requirements. Quantum multiprogramming, which runs multiple quantum jobs in parallel, is a promising approach to maximize the utilization of such systems. A key challenge in this setting is the need for an online scheduler capable of handling jobs submitted dynamically while other programs are already running. In this study, we formulate the online job scheduling problem for fault-tolerant quantum computing systems based on lattice surgery and propose an efficient scheduler to address it. To meet the responsiveness required in an online environment, our scheduler approximates lattice surgery programs, originally represented as polycubes, by using simpler cuboid representations. This approximation enables efficient scheduling while improving overall throughput. In addition, we incorporate a defragmentation mechanism into the scheduling process, demonstrating that it can further enhance QPU utilization.",

The latter one allow to recover in one-shot measurement the phase information carried out by the second momenta of the quadrature amplitudes of the output light, providing the sensitivity saturating the Quantum Cramer-Rao bound.   We show that in all considered cases, the Heisenberg scaling for the phase measurement error $\\Delta\\phi = K/N$ can be achieved, where $K\\sim1$ is a numerical prefactor and $N$ is the mean photon number.

Thus, mechanical energy is preserved on average along periodic orbits. This balance between energy gain and energy loss along different phases of the self sustained oscillation is responsible for the existence of quantized orbits in such systems. Furthermore, we show that the instantaneous preservation of projected phase space areas along quantized orbits describes the neutral dynamics of the phase, allowing us to derive from this equation the Wilson Sommerfeld like quantization condition. We apply our general results to near Hamiltonian systems, identifying the fixed points of Krylov Bogoliubov radial equation governing the dynamics of the limit cycles with the zeros of the Melnikov function. Moreover, we relate the instantaneous preservation of the phase space area along the quantized orbits to the second Krylov Bogoliubov equation describing the dynamics of the phase. We test the two quantization conditions in the context of hydrodynamic quantum analogs, where a megastable spectra of quantized orbits have recently been discovered. Specifically, we use a generalized pilot wave model for a walking droplet confined in a harmonic potential, and find a countably infinite set of nested limit cycle attractors representing a classical analog of quantized orbits.

    "summary": "Academia, governments, and industry around the world are on a quest to build long-distance quantum communication networks for a future quantum internet. Using air and fiber channels, quantum communication quickly faced the daunting challenge of exponential photon loss with distance. Quantum repeaters were invented to solve the loss problem by probabilistically establishing entanglement over short distances and using quantum memories to synchronize the teleportation of such entanglement to long distances. However, due to imperfections and complexities of quantum memories, ground-based proof-of-concept repeater demonstrations have been restricted to metropolitan-scale distances. In contrast, direct photon transmission from satellites through empty space faces almost no exponential absorption loss and only quadratic beam divergence loss. A single satellite successfully distributed entanglement over more than 1,200 km. It is becoming increasingly clear that quantum communication over large intercontinental distances (e.g. 4,000-20,000 km) will likely employ a satellite-based architecture. This could involve quantum memories and repeater protocols in satellites, or memory-less satellite-chains through which photons are simply reflected, or some combination thereof. Rapid advancements in the space launch and classical satellite communications industry provide a strong tailwind for satellite quantum communication, promising economical and easier deployment of quantum communication satellites.",

The magnetic field from polarized $d$ levels of magnetic impurities produces a field with a sharp local structure.

We present electronic structure calculations of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ with substitutional doping of Mn impurities in the dilute alloy range. Quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) ab-initio electronic structure calculations are used in conjunction with $k \\cdot p$ model Hamiltonian calculations. As expected, we observe the splitting of the Dirac points into pairs of Weyl points following the doping with Mn. We also show that the electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ can be emulated by the electronic structure of pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ with an appropriate external magnetic field. Some properties of the conductivity of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ for different magnetic field orientations are also investigated.

Our results reveal significant asymmetry in the Stokes and anti-Stokes photon generation rates, arising from the distinct effects of phase mismatch and ground-state decoherence. While phase mismatch primarily drives this asymmetry under minimal decoherence, larger decoherence further amplifies it, underscoring the complex interplay between these factors. Using the coincidence count rate representation, we provide insights into pairing ratios and demonstrate that the stimulated four-wave mixing process inherent in SFWM explains the observed phenomena. Interestingly, although ground-state decoherence reduces the generation of temporally correlated photons, it paradoxically enhances biphoton purity, as confirmed through conditional autocorrelation measurements. This counterintuitive phenomenon is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, unconditional autocorrelation measurements show that the generated photons follow a thermal-state distribution, consistent with theoretical predictions. This study advances the understanding of biphoton generation dynamics and temporal photon correlations in SFWM, offering valuable insights for optimizing SFWM-based biphoton sources and their applications in quantum technologies.",

However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.",

Quantum computing offers a promising solution: by using n qubits to compute the binding energy of a single protein-ligand pair and m additional qubits to encode different configurations, the algorithm can simultaneously evaluate 2^m combinations in a single quantum execution. To realize this potential, we propose a quantum algorithm that integrates classical force field models to compute electrostatic and van der Waals interactions on discretized grid points. Binding energy calculations are reformulated as matrix-based inner products, while ligand translations and rotations are encoded using unitary operations. This approach circumvents explicit distance calculations and provides a scalable, quantum-enhanced framework for efficient and high-dimensional binding energy estimation in drug discovery.",

The method of decoy states can detect photon-number-splitting eavesdropping and thus enables, in theory, secure QKD using weak coherent pulses over long distances with high channel loss inherent in satellite communication systems. However, it is widely known that realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to various types of side-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation. In most free-space QKD systems, including that on board Micius, multiple semiconductor lasers with passive optics are utilized to randomly generate polarization states. Optical pulses from independent laser diodes can to some extent differ in their temporal, spectral, and/or spatial distribution, and the quantum states can thus be distinguishable. Such distinguishability of photons in additional non-operational degrees of freedom compromises unconditional security of QKD since an eavesdropper can exploit this loophole to improve their attack strategy. The author carried out a thorough analysis of the experimental data obtained during multiple communication sessions between Micius and one of the ground stations designed specifically for it. Relative time delays between all the eight laser diodes on board have been found. The typical desynchronization between the lasers exceeds 100 ps, which is comparable with their pulse duration of 200 ps. The largest time delay was observed between signal and decoy states for vertically polarized photons and is about 300 ps. With such mismatch in timing, a potential attacker using as perfect equipment as possible unless it violates the laws of physics was shown to be capable of distinguishing decoy states from signal ones in at least 98.7% of cases.",

This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the LOs are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency.

Extending Landauer's principle, we show that the thermodynamic cost of observation includes not only information erasure but also the stabilization of rendered states.

In optical lattice and tweezer clocks the atom coherence times are then primarily limited by errors induced by Raman scattering from the trapping light, as well as radiative decay due to the finite lifetime of the excited clock state, broadening and loss from two-body collisions, and loss due to heating. Importantly, many of these errors take the atoms out of the clock transition subspace, and can therefore be converted into \"erasure\" errors if the appropriate readout scheme is employed. Here we experimentally demonstrate a hyperfine-resolved readout technique for 87Sr optical lattice clocks that mitigates decoherence from Raman scattering induced by the lattice trapping light as well as radiative decay. By employing hyperfine-resolved readout in synchronous differential comparisons between 87Sr ensembles with both Ramsey and spin echo spectroscopy sequences, we achieve enhanced atomic coherence times exceeding 100 s and 150 s, respectively, and demonstrate that the differential instability becomes less sensitive to the interrogation time, enabling longer coherent measurements without a reduction in performance. We anticipate that this hyperfine-resolved readout technique will benefit applications of state-of-the-art optical lattice clock comparisons in which the coherence times or stabilities are constrained by Raman scattering or radiative decay.",

    "summary": "Modeling probability distributions via the wave function of a quantum state is central to quantum-inspired generative modeling and quantum state tomography (QST). We investigate a common failure mode in training randomly initialized matrix product states (MPS) using gradient descent. The results show that the trained MPS models do not accurately predict the strong interactions between boundary sites in periodic spin chain models. In the case of the Born machine algorithm, we further identify a causality trap, where the trained MPS models resemble causal models that ignore the non-local correlations in the true distribution. We propose two complementary strategies to overcome the training failure -- one through optimization and one through initialization. First, we develop a natural gradient descent (NGD) method, which approximately simulates the gradient flow on tensor manifolds and significantly enhances training efficiency. Numerical experiments show that NGD avoids local minima in both Born machines and in general MPS tomography. Remarkably, we show that NGD with line search can converge to the global minimum in only a few iterations. Second, for the BM algorithm, we introduce a warm-start initialization based on the TTNS-Sketch algorithm. We show that gradient descent under a warm initialization does not encounter the causality trap and admits rapid convergence to the ground truth.",

Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat such sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing at capturing inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. Therefore, the scope of this study aims at resolving these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Examples demonstrate the applicability, including explicit calculations for the $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions.",

    "summary": "QAOA is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve optimization problems in gate-based quantum computers. It is based on a variational quantum circuit that can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that quantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian. This ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization problem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit tends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a small number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due to the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with decoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA requires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers is less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$. We conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of linear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear only if $p \\geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach quantum supremacy in quantum optimization.",

    "summary": "Concatenated bosonic-stabilizer codes have recently gained prominence as promising candidates for achieving low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing in the long term. In such systems, analog information obtained from the syndrome measurements of an inner bosonic code is used to inform decoding for an outer code layer consisting of a discrete-variable stabilizer code such as a surface code. The use of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes as an outer code is of particular interest due to the significantly higher encoding rates offered by these code families, leading to a further reduction in overhead for large-scale quantum computing. Recent works have investigated the performance of QLDPC-GKP codes in detail, and the use of analog information from the inner code significantly boosts decoder performance. However, the noise models assumed in these works are typically limited to depolarizing or phenomenological noise. In this paper, we investigate the performance of QLDPC-GKP concatenated codes under circuit-level noise, based on a model introduced by Noh et al. in the context of the surface-GKP code. To demonstrate the performance boost from analog information, we investigate three scenarios: (a) decoding without soft information, (b) decoding with precomputed error probabilities but without real-time soft information, and (c) decoding with real-time soft information obtained from round-to-round decoding of the inner GKP code. Results show minimal improvement between (a) and (b), but a significant boost in (c), indicating that real-time soft information is critical for concatenated decoding under circuit-level noise. We also study the effect of measurement schedules with varying depths and show that using a schedule with minimum depth is essential for obtaining reliable soft information from the inner code.",

Many quantum algorithms for imaginary-time evolution have resource requirements that are prohibitive for current quantum devices and face performance issues due to noise. Here, we propose a new algorithm for computing imaginary-time evolved expectation values on quantum computers, inspired by probabilistic error cancellation, an error-mitigation technique. Our algorithm works by decomposing a Trotterization of imaginary-time evolution into a probabilistic linear combination of operations, each of which is then implemented on a quantum computer. The measurement data is then classically post-processed to obtain the expectation value of the imaginary-time evolved state. Our algorithm requires no ancillary qubits and can be made noise-resilient without additional error mitigation. It is well-suited for estimating thermal expectation values by making use of the notion of a thermal pure quantum state. We demonstrate our algorithm by performing numerical simulations of thermal pure quantum state preparation for the 1D Heisenberg Hamiltonian on 8 qubits, and by using an IBM quantum computer to estimate the energy of the same Hamiltonian on 2 qubits. We observe promising results compared to the exact values, illustrating the potential of our algorithm for probing the physics of quantum many-body systems on current hardware.",

    "summary": "Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.",

In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, numerous ensembles have been devised, ranging from Gibbs ensembles such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles to a variety of generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. Our analysis shows that employing an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. We also numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for small finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.",

However, it is difficult to reconcile the many different approaches that have been proposed, such as those based on binary matrices, ternary trees, and stabilizer codes. This challenge is further exacerbated by the many ways to describe them -- transformation of Majorana operators, action on Fock states, encoder circuits, and stabilizers of local encodings -- making it challenging to know when the mappings are equivalent. In this work, we present a graphical framework for fermion-to-qubit mappings that streamlines and unifies various representations through the ZX-calculus.   To start, we present the correspondence between linear encodings of the Fock basis and phase-free ZX-diagrams. The commutation rules of scalable ZX-calculus allows us to convert the fermionic operators to Pauli operators under any linear encoding. Next, we give a translation from ternary tree mappings to scalable ZX-diagrams, which not only directly represents the encoder map as a CNOT circuit, but also retains the same structure as the tree. Consequently, we graphically prove that ternary tree transformations are equivalent to linear encodings, a recent result by Chiew et al. The scalable ZX representation moreover enables us to construct an algorithm to directly compute the binary matrix for any ternary tree mapping. Lastly, we present the graphical representation of local fermion-to-qubit encodings. Its encoder ZX-diagram has the same connectivity as the interaction graph of the fermionic Hamiltonian and also allows us to easily identify stabilizers of the encoding.",

However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling an $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge and hence the topological spin can be manipulated, introducing an additional knob for braiding operations in topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the effect of this fractional charge through measurable shifts in the critical current.",

This temporal and spatial variation challenges the effectiveness of fixed-distance quantum error correction (QEC) codes. In this paper, we analyze 12 days of calibration data from IBM's 127-qubit device (ibm_kyiv), showing the fluctuation of Pauli-X and CNOT gate error rates. We demonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to excessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the day. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate code distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate modeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be recovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource overhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12 calibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit overhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of usable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two additional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the overhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit usability.

First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states.

We have experimentally demonstrated the non-degenerate pumping scheme using a half-wave resonator amplifier based on NbN thin-film, and measured peak gain of 26 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. The two non-degenerate pump tones were positioned ~10 bandwidths above and below the frequency at which peak gain occurs. We have found the non-degenerate pumping scheme to be more stable compared to the usual degenerate pumping scheme in terms of gain drift against time, by a factor of 4. This scheme also retains the usual flexibility of NbN resonator parametric amplifiers in terms of reliable amplification in a ~4 K environment, and is suitable for cross-harmonic amplification. The use of pump at different frequencies allows phase-sensitive amplification when the signal tone is degenerate with the idler tone. A gain of 23 dB and squeezing ratio of 6 dB have been measured.",

Our enabling ingredient is the strong electron-light coupling produced by aloof electron reflection on an optical waveguide, leading to the emission or absorption of a high number of guided photons by every single electron. We theoretically demonstrate that, by combining electron-beam splitters with two electron-waveguide interactions, the sensitivity to detect optical-phase changes can be enhanced tenfold using currently attainable technology. We further show that waveguided NOON states comprising tens of photons can be generated at megahertz rates based on electron post-selection after electron-waveguide interaction.

Most HPC tensor network packages tackle this issue with a procedure called circuit slicing, which distributes the entire network onto multiple ranks, recombining it back when necessary. In this study, we present a novel alternative approach, where individual tensors are both broadcast and scattered to harness multiple levels of parallelism. The technique is abstracted behind a fixed distribution pattern, and actualised in a new portable tensor network library, QTNH, built on top of MPI and ScaLAPACK. We showcase its capabilities on ARCHER2, by emulating two well-known algorithms - the Quantum Fourier Transform and Random Circuit Sampling.

    "summary": "Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for numerous quantum applications, including fault-tolerant quantum computation, which is of great scientific and industrial interest. Among various QEC paradigms, topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has attained the most experimental successes by far. In this paper, we build upon existing knowledge of TQEC by developing a generalized theoretical framework of TQEC. We begin by formally defining TQEC codes and exploring the algebraic topological principles underlying these quantum codes, including deriving the conditions for any topological manifold to serve as a quantum memory. We show that TQEC for qubits works for both orientable and non-orientable manifolds. Moreover, we extend the construction of TQEC to higher-dimensional manifolds and provide examples for higher-dimensional TQEC codes. Finally, we apply these principles to construct new codes on 2-dimensional manifolds that have received limited attention in prior literature. As a case study, we simulate the performance of TQEC codes on the Klein bottle $K$ and evaluate their efficacy for quantum error correction. This work contributes to the advancement of TQEC by proposing a broader class of codes and demonstrating their theoretical and practical potential. By addressing previously unexplored topological structures, our findings represent a step forward in achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication.",

    "summary": "We propose a measurement-based quantum metrology protocol by coupling the probe (a spin ensemble) to an ancillary qubit. The key element is to use the optimized joint evolution time and the unconditional measurement on the ancillary qubit to bring the probe system from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator $|j,m\\rangle$ to a superposed state $(|j,m\\rangle+|j,-m\\rangle)/\\sqrt2$. With synchronous parametric encoding and unconditional measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system can exactly attains the Heisenberg scaling $N^2$ with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$ upon optimized initial states. The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time and the time delay between encoding and measurement. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle evolution time after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both GHZ-like state and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.",

One common strategy is amplitude encoding, which embeds a classical input vector of size N=2\\textsuperscript{n} in the amplitudes of an n-qubit register. For arbitrary vectors, the circuit depth typically scales linearly with the input size N, rapidly becoming unfeasible on near-term hardware. We propose a general-purpose procedure with sublinear average depth in N, increasing the window of utility.   Our amplitude encoding method encodes arbitrary complex vectors of size N=2\\textsuperscript{n} at any desired binary precision using a register with n qubits plus 2 ancillas and a sublinear number of multi-controlled NOT (MCX) gates, at the cost of a probabilistic success rate proportional to the sparsity of the encoded data. The core idea of our procedure is to construct an isomorphism between target states and hypercube graphs, in which specific reflections correspond to MCX gates. This reformulates the state preparation problem in terms of permutations and \\emph{binary addition}. The use of MCX gates as fundamental operations makes this approach particularly suitable for quantum platforms such as \\emph{ion traps} and \\emph{neutral atom devices}.

This has been exploited in the celebrated MIP*=RE paper and related articles to prove robust self-testing results for synchronous games when restricting to PME strategies. However, the PME assumptions are not physical, so these results need to be upgraded to make them physically relevant. In this work, we do just that: we prove that any perfect synchronous game which is a robust self-test when restricted to PME strategies, is in fact a robust self-test for all strategies.

In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems.

Furthermore, we analyse the re-usability of catalysts in the presence of such errors.

Here we show that this perception of path information is problematic. We demonstrate the simultaneous observation of zero interference visibility and the complete absence of which-path information using a three-crystal interference setup. With a contradictory argument by grouping the crystals in different ways, we show that it is impossible to ascribe a definite physical origin to the photon pair even if the emission probability of one individual source is zero and full path information is available.

For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation.

Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.",

Strong coupling and low temperature are necessary conditions for a genuine multipartite entanglement in the XY model, and together with the magnetic field, they govern the modulation of both the entanglement period and amplitude.

More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain.",

    "summary": "In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +-20 %.",

    "summary": "Accurate prediction of mRNA secondary structure is critical for understanding gene expression, translation efficiency, and advancing mRNA-based therapeutics. However, the combinatorial complexity of possible foldings, especially in long sequences, poses significant computational challenges for classical algorithms. In this work, we propose a scalable, quantum-centric optimization framework that integrates quantum sampling with classical post-processing to tackle this problem. Building on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the mRNA folding task, we develop two complementary workflows: a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based variational quantum algorithm enhanced with gauge transformations and local search, and an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit-based scheme where training is done classically and sampling is delegated to quantum hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches using IBM quantum processors, solving problem instances with up to 156 qubits and circuits containing up to 950 nonlocal gates, corresponding to mRNA sequences of up to 60 nucleotides. Additionally, we validate scalability of the CVaR algorithm on a tensor network simulator, reaching up to 354 qubits in noiseless settings. These results demonstrate the growing practical capabilities of hybrid quantum-classical methods for tackling large-scale biological optimization problems.",

We apply the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics. In both bosonic and fermionic setups, the fidelity can be enhanced beyond the equilibrium values. Under specific non-equilibrium conditions, the fidelities of all input states are identical. We call it teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Notably, at the fixed-point, fidelity can also be enhanced by combining the two detuned qubits and non-equilibrium environments. These findings provide important guidance for implementing quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, while the fixed-point mechanism offers a promising pathway toward simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.",

Such fractional responses are common in classical systems including the anomalous stress-strain behaviour of viscoelastic polymers, L\\'evy-like contaminant transport in heterogeneous porous media, and the non-Debye dielectric relaxation of glassy dielectrics. Furthermore, these unique interactions can be implemented in current quantum information architectures, with intriguing consequences for the many-body dynamics. Using a truncated Jordan-Wigner approach, we show that in the long wavelength limit of the mean field, the dynamical critical exponent is set by the fractional order q as $z=q/2$. To probe genuine many-body dynamics, we apply matrix-product-state simulations with the time-dependent variational principle adapted to nonlocal couplings. Tracking the entanglement-entropy light cone and performing finite-size scaling of the many-body gap for $0<q<2.5$, we confirm a continuously tunable exponent $z(q)$: for $q<2$ the entanglement front broadens with a sublinear light cone; for $2<q<2.5$ we observe a faint superlinear cone indicative of $z<1$; and for $q \\gtrsim 2.5$ the system reverts to the ballistic nearest-neighbour regime with $z=1$. The correspondence between quantum entanglement fronts that spread as $t^{1/z}$ and classical L\\'evy flights whose mean-square displacement grows as $t^{2/q}$ provides a direct physical link between fractional interactions and L\\'evy statistics.

The expected absence of complete error correction for near-term and intermediate-term quantum devices means that QEM protocols will remain relevant for devices with low enough error rates to attempt small examples of fault-tolerant algorithms.   Herein, we are interested in the performance of QEM with a template for quantum algorithms, quantum signal processing (QSP). QSP-based algorithms are designed with an especially simple relation between the circuit depths and the algorithm's parameters, including the required precision. Hence, they may be a useful playground for exploring QEM's practical performance and costs for a range of controlled parameters. As a preliminary step in this direction, this work explores the performance of zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) on a Hamiltonian simulation algorithm designed within QSP under local depolarizing noise.   We design a QSP-based Hamiltonian simulation of a modified Ising model under depolarizing noise for low precision and varying simulation times. We quantify for which noise and depth regimes our ZNE protocol can recover an approximation of the noiseless expectation value.   We discuss existing bounds on the sample budget, eventually using a fixed number of shots. While this does not guarantee the success of QEM, it gives us usable results in relevant cases. Finally, we briefly discuss and present a numerical study on the region where ZNE is unusable, even given an unlimited sample budget.",

Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics.

In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates.

In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with a non-trivial band structure and multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice.

We point out that quantum many-body scars exist for any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form of an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state eigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars, discovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the experimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated helix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ chains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are well-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \\to \\infty$, which allows for a systematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we predict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space, Granovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay: depending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is either slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be traced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which corresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the limiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product states (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that our prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit.

To this end, we first demonstrate that the open dynamics of CMs with sequentially generated correlations between groups of ancillas can be mapped onto a composite CM, where the memory part of the environment is incorporated into an enlarged Markovian system. We then apply this framework to an all-qubit CM, and show that non-Markovian behavior emerges only when the next incoming pair of ancillas are entangled prior to colliding with the system. On the other hand, when system-ancilla collisions precede ancilla-ancilla entanglement, we find the open dynamics to always be Markovian. Our findings highlight how certain qualitative features of inter-ancilla correlations can strongly influence the onset of system non-Markovianity.",

Beyond the experimental point-to-point demonstrations of the past few years, efforts are now underway to integrate QKD at the network level: developing interfaces with the software-defined-network ecosystem; but also network planning tools that satisfy physical-layer contraints jointly on the classical and quantum signals. We have found that in certain situations, na\\\"ive network planning prioritizing quantum traffic drastically degrades classical capacity, whereas a quantum-aware wavelength assignment heuristic allows coexistence with minimal impact on both capacities.

We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies.

We introduce the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to the Poincar\\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting.

It allows to describe a multitude of quantum phenomena, however its universality comes at a cost - without additional constraints, the resultant dynamics are not necessarily thermodynamically consistent, and the equation itself lacks an intuitive interpretation.   We present a mathematically equivalent form of the Lindblad master equation under a single constraint of strict energy conservation. The \"elemental Bloch\" equation separates the system dynamics into its elemental parts, making an explicit distinction between thermal mixing, dephasing, and energy relaxation, and thus reinstating the physical intuition in the equation. We derive the equation for a many-level system by accounting for all relevant transitions between pairs of levels.

However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine PVMs.",

Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.",

    "summary": "Classical metastability manifests as noise-driven switching between disjoint basins of attraction and slowing down of relaxation, quantum systems like qubits and Rydberg atoms exhibit analogous behavior through collective quantum jumps and long-lived Liouvillian modes with a small spectral gap. Though any metastable mode is expected to decay after a finite time, stochastic switching persists indefinitely. Here, we elaborate on the connection between switching dynamics and quantum metastability through the lens of the large deviation principles, spectral decomposition, and quantum-jump simulations. Specifically, we distinguish the trajectory-level noise-induced metastability (stochastic switching) from the spectrum-level deterministic metastability (small Liouvillian gap) in a Markovian open quantum system with bistability. Without stochastic switching, whether a small spectral gap leads to slow relaxation depends on initial states. In contrast, with switching, the memory of initial conditions is quickly lost, and the relaxation is limited by the rare switching between the metastable states. Consistent with the exponential scaling of the Liouvillian gap with system size, the switching rates conform to the Arrhenius law, with the inverse system size serving as the nonequilibrium analog of temperature. Using the dynamical path integral and the instanton approach, we further extend the connection between the quasipotential functional and the probabilities of rare fluctuations to the quantum realm. These results provide new insights into quantum bistability and the relaxation processes of strongly interacting, dissipative quantum systems far away from the thermodynamic limit.",

We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$.

To validate this approach, we compare the results to the adiabatic-nuclei approximation based on fixed-nuclei ab initio R-matrix calculations.

We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods.

    "summary": "By employing the Naimark dilation, we establish a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian quantum sensing and post-selected measurements. The sensitivity of non-Hermitian quantum sensors is determined by the effective quantum Fisher information (QFI), which incorporates the success probability of post-selection. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian sensors cannot outperform their Hermitian counterpart when all information is harnessed, since the total QFI for the extended system constrains the effective QFI of the non-Hermitian subsystem. Moreover, we quantify the efficiency of non-Hermitian sensors with the ratio of the effective QFI to the total QFI, which can be optimized within the framework of post-selected measurements with minimal experimental trials. Our work provides a distinctive theoretical framework for investigating non-Hermitian quantum sensing and designing noise-resilient quantum metrological protocols.",

The hole was fabricated using anisotropic etching of a silicon substrate and was designed to minimize potential distortion in the trapping region. By introducing the atomic beam through the hole, we achieved enhanced isotope selectivity and experimentally demonstrated the selective trapping of calcium isotope ions using an atomic oven. We successfully prepared isotope ion pairs directly from the oven via sympathetic cooling at a rate comparable to that achieved using ablation loading. The sympathetic cooling process occurred on the order of a few seconds. We demonstrated the direct generation of an ion chain above the through-hole. This approach can be applied for trapping a wide range of ion species using a remarkably simple experimental setup, making it desirable for several applications such as quantum-charge-coupled-device (QCCD) architectures and precision measurements of isotope shifts.",

    "summary": "Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of ${\\pi}$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase shows robustness against different imperfections in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.",

    "summary": "Quantum metrology is a promising application of quantum technologies, enabling the precise measurement of weak external fields at a local scale. In typical quantum sensing protocols, a qubit interacts with an external field, and the amplitude of the field is estimated by analyzing the expectation value of a measured observable. Sensitivity can, in principle, be enhanced by increasing the number of qubits within a fixed volume, thereby maintaining spatial resolution. However, at high qubit densities, inter-qubit interactions induce complex many-body dynamics, resulting in multiple oscillations in the expectation value of the observable even for small field amplitudes. This ambiguity reduces the dynamic range of the sensing protocol. We propose a method to overcome the limitation in quantum metrology by adopting a quantum circuit learning framework using a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate a target function by optimizing the circuit parameters. In our method, after the qubits interact with the external field, we apply a sequence of parameterized quantum gates and measure a suitable observable. By optimizing the gate parameters, the expectation value is trained to exhibit a monotonic response within a target range of field amplitudes, thereby eliminating multiple oscillations and enhancing the dynamic range. This method offers a strategy for improving quantum sensing performance in dense qubit systems.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether, and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.",

We demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This non-monotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity pave the way for creation of nonlinear optical devices.",

Ring-polymer instanton theories offer a very promising approach to solve this problem, since they can be rigorously derived using semiclassical approximations and can capture nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling and zero-point energy at a cost similar to that of a classical calculation. A successful instanton rate theory already exists within the Born--Oppenheimer approximation, for which the optimal tunnelling pathway is located on a single adiabatic surface. A related instanton theory has also been developed for nonadiabatic reactions using two weakly-coupled diabatic surfaces within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. However, many chemical reactions do not satisfy the conditions of either limit. By employing a tunable dividing surface which measures the flux both along nuclear coordinates as well as between electronic states, we develop a generalised nonadiabatic instanton rate theory that bridges between these two limits. The resulting theory approximates the quantum-mechanically exact rates well for the systems studied and, in addition, offers a novel mechanistic perspective on nonadiabatic reactions.",

The first chapter presents a self-contained introduction to the field of cavity QED. Following this introductory material, we show in Chapter 2 how measurements of the field emitted by a cavity can be leveraged for in-situ qubit noise spectroscopy in the presence of significant inhomogeneous broadening. We also identify a signature of genuinely quantum noise in the cavity output field originating from the non-commutation of bath operators acting on the qubit. In Chapter 3, we present a novel quantum-optical effect whereby a suitable modulation of a longitudinal cavity-qubit coupling can be used to entangle the state of a qubit with the path taken by a multiphoton wavepacket. Entanglement between a qubit and a which-path degree-of-freedom can in turn be used to generate entanglement between distant stationary qubits. As shown in Chapter 4, qubit-which-path entanglement can also be exploited for maximally sensitive estimation of a phase in a Mach-Zehnder interferometry setup, i.e., sensing at the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound. In Chapter 5, we discuss strategies for realizing stabilizer measurements using qubit-conditioned phase shifts applied to propagating pulses of radiation. We find that in the context of a subsystem surface code, photon loss during such stabilizer measurements would not introduce any horizontal hook errors on the code qubits. In the sixth and final chapter, we give protocols for performing entangling gates between distant stationary qubits using Fock- or time-bin encoded photons.",

The fidelity of purified states represents the noise floor of a given computation and we show its dependence on both the magnitude and order in which magic and entanglement are generated. Using an ion trap quantum device, we experimentally validate these findings by collecting classical shadow data for a range of small circuits. While overall consistent, our results reveal meaningful differences in the captured qubit correlations, further highlighting the gap between conventional numerical studies and real experimental outcomes. In both simulation and experiment, we show the advantage of designing methods targeting states which are more robust against noise.

    "summary": "Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\\le c_{\\text{relax}}\\le c_{\\text{LR}}\\le c_{\\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.",

Our proposed methods scale linearly with the parameters of interest and significantly reduce the computational complexity of pricing exotics compared to conventional methods. For Asian options, we present two methods: a tensor train cross approximation-based method for pricing, and a variational pricing method using MPS, which provides a stringent lower bound on option prices. For multi-asset American basket options, we combine the decoupled trees technique with the tensor train cross approximation to efficiently handle baskets of up to $m = 8$ correlated assets. All approaches scale linearly in the number of discretization steps $N$ for Asian options, and the number of assets $m$ for multi-asset options.

    "summary": "We investigate how isolated quantum many-body systems equilibrate when quenched far from equilibrium under non-Abelian gauge-symmetry constraints. By encoding gauge superselection sectors into static $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ background charges, we map out the dynamical phase diagram of a $1+1D$ $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter. We uncover three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase, (ii) a fragmented phase that is nonthermal but delocalized, and (iii) a disorder-free many-body localized regime. In the latter, a superposition of superselection sectors retains spatial matter inhomogeneities in time, as confirmed by distinctive temporal scalings of entropy. We highlight the non-Abelian nature of these phases and argue for potential realizations on qudit processors.",

    "summary": "Combinatorial optimization problems have wide-ranging applications in industry and academia. Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.",

Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day.

While the effect of phase noise in the regimes of isolated qubits and few-qubit gate protocols has been studied extensively, there are open questions about the effects of this noise on many-body systems. In many scenarios, the effects of noise cannot simply be described by an increase in the energy or temperature of the system, leading to non-trivial changes in the state and relevant correlations. In this work, we use stochastic sampling to simulate laser phase noise based on experimentally relevant spectral densities. We explore the impact of this noise on adiabatic state preparation in a one-dimensional system, discussing the interplay between heating and interactions during dynamics. We find that for certain adiabatic processes, the noise can be seen to approximately thermalize in terms of its effects on relevant correlation functions.",

This approach mixes temporal and spatial correlations in a manner distinct from traditional metrology, leading to ambiguities in how one identifies Heisenberg scalings (e.g.~standard asymptotic metrics like the sensitivity are not bounded by system size). Here, we propose a new metric for continuous sensing, the optimized finite-time environmental quantum Fisher information (QFI), that remedies the above issues by simultaneously treating time and system size as finite resources. In addition to having direct experimental relevance, this quantity is rigorously bounded by both system size and integration time, allowing for a precise formulation of Heisenberg scaling. We also introduce two many-body continuous sensors: the high-temperature superradiant sensor, and the dissipative spin squeezer. Both exhibit Heisenberg scaling of a collective magnetic field for multiple directions. The spin squeezed sensor has a striking advantage over previously studied many-body continuous sensors: the optimal measurement achieving the full QFI does not require the construction of a complex decoder system, but can be achieved using direct photodetection of the cavity output field.",

Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete application in a real-world scenario.

One of the fundamental tools to efficiently simulate quantum dynamics is the Trotter decomposition of the time-evolution operator, and various quantum-classical hybrid algorithms have been proposed to implement Trotterization. Given that some quantum hardware is publicly accessible, it is important to assess the practical performance of Trotterization on them. However, a straightforward Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian often leads to quantum circuits with large depth, which hinders accurate simulation on devices with limited coherence time. In this work, we propose a hardware-efficient Trotterization scheme for the time evolution of a 3-site, $J=1$ XXX Heisenberg model. By exploiting the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that acts on a reduced subspace, significantly lowering the circuit depth after optimization for specific evolution times. This approach can be interpreted as a change of basis in the standard Trotterization scheme. We also test our method on the IBM Quantum device ibmq_jakarta. Combining with the readout error mitigation and the zero-noise extrapolation, we obtain the fidelity $0.9928 \\pm 0.0013$ for the simulation of the time evolution of the Heisenberg model from the time $t=0$ to $t=\\pi$.",

State-of-the-art optical lattice clocks interrogate large ensembles to minimize the SQL, but density-dependent frequency shifts pose challenges to scaling the atom number. The SQL can be surpassed, however, by leveraging entanglement, though it remains an open problem to achieve quantum advantage from spin squeezing at state-of-the-art stability levels. Here we demonstrate clock performance beyond the SQL, achieving a fractional frequency precision of 1.1 $\\times 10^{-18}$ for a single spin-squeezed clock.

    "summary": "In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.",

Comparing our approach with standard ZNE reveals that adaptive scaling factors can be optimized using either a noise model or direct error strength measurements from inverted circuits.

This approach has already been successfully employed for the game of Checkers. In this work, we describe the application of this method to the context of Connect Four, in order to study its performance in a different setting, which can lead to a better generalization of the technique. We also kept track of a metric that wasn't taken into account in previous work: the average number of iterations to obtain a flagged action. Since going second is a significant disadvantage in Connect Four, we also had the intent of exploring how this more complex scenario would impact the performance of our approach. The experiments involved training and testing classical and quantum RL agents that played either going first or going second against a Randomized Negamax opponent. The results showed that both flagged exploration policies were clearly superior to a simple epsilon-greedy policy. Furthermore, the quantum agents did in fact sample flagged actions in less iterations.

We investigate the trade-off between entanglement-enhanced sensitivity and robustness against laser noise in order to identify optimal initial states, measurement schemes and estimation strategies. Beside standard protocols based on coherent spin states, squeezed spin states and GHZ states, we consider variational Ramsey protocols implemented via low-depth quantum circuits based on one-axis twisting operations to approach optimal stability. In particular, we review known and identify new optimal interrogation schemes for a variety of scenarios, including different experimental platforms, ensemble sizes and regimes characterized by a wide range of interrogation durations and dead times. Hence, this work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for optimizing Ramsey interrogation schemes, providing guidance for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks.",

The analytical calculations reveal the optimal parametric gain and phase parameters for achieving optimum unconventional photon blockade conditions. Under the optimal parameter regime, the numerical results of the second-order correlation function demonstrate strong photon antibunching consistent with the analytical results. Furthermore, the numerical results corroborate that coherently driving the atom leads to a stronger photon blockade than a coherently driven cavity with the optimal parameters. We numerically demonstrate that the UPB effect is compromised by a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the cavity-driven configuration. However, stronger photon antibunching can be attained with a non-zero cavity-atom coupling in the atom-driven configuration. This work may be suitable for experimentally realising a strongly antibunched single-photon source for applications in quantum technology.",

While higher-order schemes have been extensively studied, the landscape of second-order decompositions remains poorly understood in practice. We explore how term ordering and recursive application of the Suzuki formula generate a broad family of approximants beyond standard Strang splitting, introducing a hybrid heuristic that minimizes local error bounds and a fractional approach with tunable sequence length. The hybrid method consistently selects the longest possible decomposition, achieving the lowest error but at the cost of exponential gate overhead, while fractional decompositions often match or exceed this performance with far fewer gates, enabling offline selection of near-optimal approximants for practical quantum simulation. This offers a simple, compiler-accessible heuristic for balancing accuracy and cost, and highlights an underexplored region of decomposition space where many low-cost approximants may achieve high accuracy without global optimization. Finally, we show that in the presence of depolarising noise, fractional decompositions become advantageous as systems approach fault-tolerant error rates, providing a practical path for balancing noise resistance and simulation accuracy.",

Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.",

Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.",

    "summary": "Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have attracted much attention for their broadband amplification and near-quantum-limited noise performance. TWPAs are non-reciprocal by nature providing gain for forward-propagating signals and transmission line losses for backward traveling waves. This intrinsic non-reciprocity is insufficient to protect sensitive quantum devices from back-action due to noise from warmer amplification stages in practical systems, and thus necessitates the need for bulky cryogenic isolators. We present a multi-stage Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (mTWPA) that addresses this limitation by achieving passive in-band reverse isolation alongside near-quantum-limited noise performance. The multi-stage architecture consists of two, mode conversion stages and a reflectionless high-pass filter which provides the passive isolation. Experimental measurements of a prototype mTWPA demonstrated 20 dB of forward gain across a 1.6 GHz bandwidth and greater than 35 dB of reverse isolation. Noise measurements indicate performance at 1.7 times the quantum limit. This demonstrates that the increased complexity of a multi-stage TWPA design does not lead to significant added noise. The designed distribution of gain across the stages is engineered to minimize internal amplifier noise at the input, and we propose further optimization strategies in redistribution of the gain between the stages. This level of isolation effectively mitigates noise from warmer amplification stages, matching the performance of conventional isolators. The mTWPA approach offers a scalable path forward for more efficient and compact quantum circuit readout systems.",

The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power.

One of them is measurement device independent (MDI) QKD, which can be implemented using present-day technology and generates a reasonable key rate. The protocol works perfectly fine for intracity communication. However, the transmission distance is not enough, so that it can replace intercity communication. For that, adaptive measurement device-independent (AMDI) QKD has been proposed. So, the present-day classical communication network such as the internet can be replaced with its quantum version. Till the date, AMDI-QKD has been implemented with threshold detectors. In this paper, we replaced threshold detectors with photon-number resolving detectors, thus making the protocol more realistic.

The computational complexity scales linearly with the number of qudits in the initial state and exponentially with the number of qudits in the final state. This ensures that when noisy qudit stabilizer states evolve via generalized Pauli measurements and Clifford operations to generate multipartite entangled states of a few qudits, their description remains efficient.

Access to the quantum state of a program is limited, execution time is expensive and noise can significantly distort measurement outcomes. To address these problems, this work proposes a framework that assists developers in the evaluation of runtime assertions on real quantum computers. It translates a variety of assertions into sets of measurements, reduces execution overhead where possible and evaluates the measurement results after the execution even in the presence of noise. This approach substantially aids developers in the debugging process, enabling efficient assertion-driven debugging even in large programs.

Although experimental platforms for HD QKD exist, previous security analyses were limited to the asymptotic regime and have either relied on impractical measurements or employed computationally demanding convex optimization tasks restricting the security analysis to low dimensions. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting a composable finite-size security proof against both collective and coherent attacks for a general HD QKD protocol that utilizes only experimentally accessible measurements. In addition to the conventional, yet impractical `one-shot' key rates, we also provide a practical variable-length security argument that yields significantly higher expected key rates.

Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size.

Additionally, we report spectral tuning of a qumode comb pair over one free-spectral range of the OPA, thus bridging the spacing between the discrete modes of the QFC. Our results significantly advance both the generation and detection of nanophotonic squeezed light in a broadband and multimode platform, establishing a scalable, chip-integrated path for compact quantum sensors and continuous-variable quantum information processing systems.",

    "summary": "Classical physics is often a good approximation for quantum systems composed of many interacting particles, although wavepacket dispersion and scattering processes continuously induce delocalization and entanglement. According to decoherence theory, an entangled ensemble can appear classical when only a subset of all particles is observed. This emergence of macroscopic phenomena from quantum interactions is, for example, relevant for phase transitions, quantum thermalization, hydrodynamics, spin liquids, or time crystals. However, entanglement and decoherence in free electrons have not yet been explored, although the electron is a fundamental elementary particle with extraordinary technological relevance. Here, we investigate the degree of coherence and entanglement in a free-space electron gas in the beam of an ultrafast electron microscope. We introduce a two-electron quantum walk that transforms the quantum state into different bases for quantum state tomography of entangled or partially entangled electron-electron pairs. We apply this novel diagnostic to study quantum effects in short pulses of hundreds of electrons under strong Coulomb correlation. We observe a high contrast interference in the electron-electron correlations but no significant signs of electron-electron entanglement which we explain by limited purity of the initial states and decoherence effects from unmeasured reservoir electrons. The ability to characterize quantum states of multiple free electrons may allow verification of electron-electron entanglement for use in fundamental studies and quantum electron microscopy.",

    "summary": "Quantum error correction requires accurate and efficient decoding to optimally suppress errors in the encoded information. For concatenated codes, where one code is embedded within another, optimal decoding can be achieved using a message-passing algorithm that sends conditional error probabilities from the lower-level code to a higher-level decoder. In this work, we study the XYZ$^2$ topological stabilizer code, defined on a honeycomb lattice, and use the fact that it can be viewed as a concatenation of a [[2, 1, 1]] phase-flip parity check code and the surface code with $YZZY$ stabilizers, to decode the syndrome information in two steps. We use this sequential decoding scheme to correct errors on data qubits, as well as measurement errors, under various biased error models using both a maximum-likelihood decoder (MLD) and more efficient matching-based decoders. For depolarizing noise we find that the sequential matching decoder gives a threshold of 18.3%, close to optimal, as a consequence of a favorable, effectively biased, error model on the upper-level YZZY code. For phase-biased noise on data qubits, at a bias $\\eta = \\frac{p_z}{p_x+p_y} = 10$, we find that a belief-matching-based decoder reaches thresholds of 24.1%, compared to 28.6% for the MLD. With measurement errors the thresholds are reduced to 3.4% and 4.3%, for depolarizing and biased noise respectively, using the belief-matching decoder. This demonstrates that the XYZ$^2$ code has thresholds that are competitive with other codes tailored to biased noise. The results also showcase two approaches to taking advantage of concatenated codes: 1) tailoring the upper-level code to the effective noise profile of the decoded lower-level code, and 2) making use of an upper-level decoder that can utilize the local information from the lower-level code.",

Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states -- a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, in which hotter liquids freeze faster than colder ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian spectrum plays a critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.",

However, in nonlinear multi-photon regimes, these classical mechanisms break down, revealing new possibilities for light emission. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mechanism, termed triggered emission, in which an emitter, largely detuned from single-photon states, is triggered by the quantum state of the environment to emit a highly correlated photon pair, doublon. By identifying two critical conditions, energy matching and wavefunction overlap, we demonstrate that the dynamics of the emitter are profoundly shaped by the environment's quantum state. Using this framework, we construct a novel superposition state comprising a localized single-photon state and a propagating, strongly correlated two-photon wavepacket. Furthermore, we realize the multi-photon unidirectional emission by modulating the emitter and the photon state. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear emitter dynamics but also provide a versatile platform for quantum computing and quantum information processing.",

However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks.

However, the limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices introduce significant challenges in achieving ideal performance due to noise interference, such as decoherence, gate errors, and readout errors. This paper presents an extensive comparative analysis of two HQNN algorithms, Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanNN), assessing their noise resilience across diverse image classification tasks. We systematically inject noise into variational quantum circuits using five quantum noise channels: Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and Depolarizing Noise. By varying noise probabilities from 0.1 to 1.0, we evaluate the correlation between noise robustness and model behavior across different noise levels.   Our findings demonstrate that different noise types and levels significantly influence HQNN performance. The QuanNN shows robust performance across most noise channels for low noise levels (0.1 - 0.4), but succumbs to diverse effects of depolarizing and amplitude damping noise at probabilities between (0.5 - 1.0). However, the QuanNN exhibits robustness to bit flip noise at high probabilities (0.9 - 1.0). On the other hand, the QCNN tends to benefit from the noise injection by outperforming noise-free models for bit flip, phase flip, and phase damping at high noise probabilities. However, for other noise types, the QCNN shows gradual performance degradation as noise increases. These insights aim to guide future research in error mitigation strategies to enhance HQNN models in the NISQ era.",

Although we predictably find that neural networks yield better accuracy, we also find that the way that the two methods reach their prediction is starkly different. This is seen by the measurements which arthe most important for the classification. Neural networks follow the intuitive prediction that measurements containing information about non-local coherences are most important for entanglement, but random forests signify the dominance of information contained in occupation measurements. This is because occupation measurements are necessary for the extraction of data about all other density matrix elements from the remaining measurements. The same discrepancy does not occur when the models are used to learn entanglement directly from the elements of the density matrix, so it is the result of the scattering of information and interdependence of measurement data. As a result, the models behave differently when noise is introduced to various measurements, which can be harnessed to obtain more reliable information about entanglement from noisy tomography data.",

The inherent non-centrosymmetric lattice symmetry of NbOCl$_2$ enables direct generation of polarization-entangled Bell states without the need for post-selection, leveraging its exceptional second-order nonlinear susceptibility, which surpasses conventional nonlinear materials. By nanopatterning NbOCl$_2$ into a high-quality-factor metasurface, we achieve three orders of magnitude enhancement in photon-pair generation efficiency via resonant excitation of bound states in the continuum resonance, which intensify light-matter interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate in situ electrical tunability of the photon-pair emission wavelength over a 250 nm range from 1450 nm to 1700 nm by dynamically modulating surrounding liquid crystal layer.

In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.",

    "summary": "We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to the case of quantum gravity (QG) by using the effective action for a QG theory. This is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action equations of motion, which is beneficial even in the non-gravitational case, since in this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity relations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound states. Another advantage of the effective action formalism is that one can obtain the field configurations in the case of a quantum field theory (QFT). The proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB wavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe and in order to define the effective action for an arbitrary initial state one needs a QG path integral. The QG effective action can be constructed by using the piecewise flat quantum gravity (PFQG) theory and the PFQG effective action can be approximated by the QFT effective action for General Relativity coupled to matter, with a cutoff determined by the average edge length of the spacetime triangulation. One can then calculate the corresponding field configurations and from these field configurations one can obtain the trajectories for the corresponding elementary particles.",

Achieving a true violation of the Heisenberg limit-considering photon loss, detection ineffciency, and other imperfections-remains an open challenge. Here, we present an ultrahigh-effciency quantum switch to estimate the geometric phase associated with a pair of conjugate position and momentum displacements embedded in a superposition of causal orders. Our experimental data demonstrate precision surpassing the global Heisenberg limit without artificially correcting for losses or imperfections.

The two particles are initially prepared in a maximally entangled state and evolve independently. Using numerically exact calculations of position probability densities, average interparticle distance, entanglement entropy, and concurrence, we examine how dissipation and particle-exchange symmetry of the state (symmetric or antisymmetric) influence the resulting correlations. Notably, we find that the entanglement entropy of the antisymmetric state decays slower than that of the symmetric state at the exceptional point of the model. We also show that, in the antisymmetric state, the concurrence measured on the one-particle reduced density operator is unaffected by dissipation. Furthermore, we discuss how these correlations indicate quantum-to-classical transitions through the appearance of Gaussian position probability densities, sub-linear growth of average interparticle distance after a few steps, and decay of the entanglement entropy. On the other hand, the robustness of the qubit entanglement entropy can differentiate the model's topological phases better than in the one-particle quantum walk scenario.",

    "summary": "Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using Brillouin light scattering by magnons without phase singularities. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.",

The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes.

Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance.

Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures.

We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.",

This is achieved by embedding low-distance encodings into the surface code in the form of topological defects. We introduce a family of Ladder Encodings (LE), which is optimal in the sense that the code distance is equal to the weights of density and nearest-neighbor hopping operators of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. In two dimensions, we show how to scale the code distance of LE as well as other low-distance encodings such as Verstraete-Cirac and Derby-Klassen. We further introduce Perforated Encodings, which locally encode two fermionic spin modes within the same surface code structure. We show that our strategy is also extendable to other topological codes by explicitly embedding the LE into a 6.6.6 color code.",

As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity.

We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons.

These measures require polarization-sensitive sensing which remains largely unaddressed in quantum-imaging techniques with undetected light. However, the bicolor nature and supreme phase sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers make them particularly advantageous for biological sensing.

Due to the finite speed of light, diffracting light pulses cannot interact simultaneously with both arms, inducing phase perturbations that compromise the accuracy of the sensor -- an effect that becomes progressively important as spatial separations increase. For a consistent framework, we develop a theory for finite-speed-of-light effects in atom interferometers alongside with other relativistic effects such as the mass defect. Our analysis shows that their magnitude depends crucially on the diffraction mechanism and the specific interferometer geometry. We demonstrate that the velocity of the atomic cloud at the mirror pulse of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is less critical than the precise tuning of the lasers for resonant diffraction.

While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness.

Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem.

The formalism consists on a set of coupled delay differential equations for the emitter's polarizations $\\sigma^\\pm_i$, supplemented by input-output relations that describe the field mediating the interactions. These equations capture the dynamics of both linear (bosonic) and nonlinear (two-level) emitter arrays. It is exact in some limits$-$e.g., bosonic emitters or generic systems with up to one collective excitation$-$and can be integrated to provide accurate results for larger numbers of photons. These equations support a study of collective spontaneous emission of emitter arrays in open waveguide-QED environments. This study uncovers an effect we term cascaded super- and sub-radiance, characterized by light-cone-limited propagation and increasingly correlated photon emission across distant emitters. The collective nature of this dynamics for two-level systems is evident both in the enhancement of collective emission rates, as well as in a superradiant burst with a faster than linear growth. While these effects should be observable in existing circuit QED devices or slight generalizations thereof, the formalism put forward in this work can be extended to model other systems such as network of quantum emitters or the generation of correlated photon states.",

    "summary": "Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\\mathcal{O}(\\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous.

    "summary": "An investigation into Schwinger pair production mechanisms is presented, demonstrating that vacuum tunneling processes can be effectively controlled through electromagnetic potential modulation while maintaining the strong ffelds in the interaction region. This challenges the conventional paradigm that attributes exclusive governance of Schwinger processes to localized ffeld intensities. Through comprehensive analysis of particle number, momentum spectra, and spatial distribution of created pairs, we establish that the observed modulation effects originate from electromagnetic potential - induced modiffcations to the quantum phase structure of virtual particles. This phenomenon reveals a profound connection between Schwinger tunneling dynamics and the geometric phase properties of the quantum vacuum state - a vacuum analogue to the Aharonov-Bohm effect in charged particle systems. This discovery not only advances our understanding of electromagnetic interactions in quantum vacuum but also opens up new experimental opportunities for realizing Schwinger tunneling processes with existing facilities.",

To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them.

These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.",

By analytically deriving memory bounds and supporting our findings with numerical simulations, we show that non-Markovian reservoirs can outperform their Markovian counterparts, particularly in tasks that require a coexistence of short- and long-term correlations. We introduce an embedding approach that allows a controlled transition from Markovian to non-Markovian evolution, providing a path for practical implementations.

As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.",

However, the current performance falls short of these requirements due to the inherent trade-off between memory efficiency enhancement and noise amplification, which not only imposes significant demands on quantum purification but also fundamentally impedes continuous-variable quantum information processing. In this paper, we break through these constraints, enabling high-performance quantum memory and unlocking new possibilities for quantum technologies. We unveil a Hankel-transform spatiotemporal mapping for light-spinwave conversion in quantum memory, and propose an intelligent light-manipulated strategy for adaptive spinwave compaction, which can maximize the conversion efficiency and simultaneously suppress the excess noise. This strategy is experimentally demonstrated for a Raman quantum memory in warm 87Rb atomic vapor with an efficiency up to 94.6% and a low noise level of only 0.026 photons/pulse. The unconditional fidelity reaches 98.91% with an average of 1.0 photons/pulse for a 17-ns input signal.

Hence, the central task of GAD is to calculate the probability density function of a new data point by retrieving its mean values and covariance matrix, which could be time-consuming when addressing a large dataset. Recently, several quantum algorithms have been proposed to for GAD, which have been shown significantly faster than the classical counterparts under certain conditions. However, they all require quantum phase estimation as a key subroutine that may have exponentially high quantum circuit depth and is not desirable in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this paper, we propose a new quantum algorithm for GAD without phase estimation, whose quantum circuit has depth only linear in the number of qubits, which is relatively more friendly on NISQ devices. Specifically, building on arithmetic-free black-box quantum state preparation (AFBBQSP), our quantum algorithm outputs the estimates of the mean values and the covariance matrix both in the classical form, so that anomaly detection of any data point can be done immediately on a classical computer at little cost. It is shown that our quantum algorithm is highly efficient when handling low-dimensional datasets with well-conditioned data matrices. Moreover, unlike prior quantum algorithms for GAD which require the input data to be quantum, mean centered, or feature correlated, our quantum algorithm release these constraints and thus is more data practical. Our work highlights the role of AFBBQSP in bringing quantum machine learning closer to reality.",

It is important to understand what is guaranteed to be improved from successful EPP with arbitrary non-identical input, which determines whether we want to perform the EPP at all. When successful EPP can offer improvement, the time to perform the EPP should also be optimized to maximize the improvement. In this work, we study the guaranteed improvement and optimal time for the CNOT-based recurrence EPP, previously shown to be optimal in various scenarios. We firstly prove guaranteed improvement for multiple figures of merit, including fidelity and several entanglement measures when compared to practical baselines as functions of input states. However, it is noteworthy that the guaranteed improvement we prove does not imply the universality of the EPP as introduced in arXiv:2407.21760. Then we prove robust, parameter-independent optimal time for typical error models and figures of merit. We further explore memory decoherence described by continuous-time Pauli channels, and demonstrate the phenomenon of optimal time transition when the memory decoherence error pattern changes.

Simulations reveal that longer paths with prior entanglements can establish e2e entanglement faster than shorter paths under certain conditions.

In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources.

We then present the details of constructing gauge-invariant packaged qubits (or qudits), packaged gates, and packaged circuits (which commute with the total charge operator). These serve as alternative foundation for gauge-invariant quantum information science. We then adapt conventional quantum error-correction codes, quantum algorithms, and quantum communication protocols to the ($d \\times D$)-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace. This high-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace is flexible for pruning and scaling to match available physics systems. Thus, packaged quantum information processing becomes feasible and testable. Our results show that the gauge-invariant packaged quantum states may provide a possible route toward robust, fault-tolerant, and secure quantum technologies.",

By precisely controlling the evolution of quantum parameters along the acyclic path of the Bloch sphere, NNGQC is able to realize quantum logic gates under non-adiabatic conditions, which not only improves the speed of the operation, but also increases the path degrees of freedom, providing more operational flexibility and robustness for quantum computation. However, past work on NNGQC has not given a universal solution for different gate constructions, meanwhile due to the inability to optionally avoid some trajectory segments seriously affected by systematic errors, the performance of arbitrary geometric gate is still unsatisfactory. Here we give the general scheme of NNGQC, and also summarize the optimal gate construction corresponding to different schemes, and it is worth mentioning that we creatively introduce the universal robust control. Numerical simulations verifies that it is perfectly compatible with all types of noise terms and outperforms the transmission dynamic gates and quantum logic gates in the NGQC framework in terms of gate fidelity and robustness performance. Thus, our scheme can give the ideal quantum gate construction under noncyclic conditions, which sheds light on future large-scale quantum computation.",

For processes involving single spins and first-order chemical reactions, this is a well-researched topic, but time evolution of complex nuclear spin systems in the presence of second-order kinetics, diffusion, and flow has so far remained intractable. This creates obstacles in microfluidics, homogeneous catalysis, and magnetic resonance imaging of metabolic processes.

Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. In this paper, we analyse the quantum transduction from a communication perspective, by shedding the light on its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different types of transduction, including the one allowing a transducer to act as entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances.

Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.",

Here we combine the solution of the CSE with a form of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning (RL) to generate highly compact circuits that implement this ansatz without sacrificing accuracy. As a natural extension of CSE, we reformulate the wavefunction update as a Markovian decision process and train the agent to select the optimal actions at each iteration based upon only the current CSE residual.

BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.",

However, the simulation of open quantum systems - where interactions with the environment play a crucial role - remains challenging for quantum computing, as it is impossible to implement deterministically non-unitary operators on a quantum computer without auxiliary qubits. The Stinespring dilation can simulate an open dynamic but requires a high circuit depth, which is impractical for NISQ devices. An alternative approach is parallel probabilistic block-encoding methods, such as the Sz.-Nagy and Singular Value Decomposition dilations. These methods result in shallower circuits but are hybrid methods, and we do not simulate the quantum dynamic on the quantum computer. In this work, we describe a divide-and-conquer strategy for preparing mixed states to combine the output of each Kraus operator dilation and obtain the complete dynamic on quantum hardware with a lower circuit depth. The work also introduces a balanced strategy that groups the original Kraus operators into an expanded operator, leading to a trade-off between circuit depth, CNOT count, and number of qubits. We perform a computational analysis to demonstrate the advantages of the new method and present a proof-of-concept simulation of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson dynamic on current quantum hardware.",

    "summary": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a crucial optimization challenge with significant economic and environmental implications, particularly in logistics and transportation planning. While classical algorithms struggle to efficiently solve large-scale instances of VRP due to its combinatorial complexity, quantum computing presents a promising alternative for tackling such problems. In this work, we explore the application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve instances of VRP, analyzing its effectiveness and scalability. We formulate VRP as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem by encoding the constraints into a single cost function suitable for QAOA. Our study investigates the impact of problem size on quantum circuit complexity and evaluate the feasibility of executing QAOA-based VRP solutions on near-term quantum hardware. The results indicate that while QAOA demonstrates potential for solving VRP, the primary limitation lies in circuit depth and noise-induced errors, which critically affect performance on current quantum processors. Overcoming these challenges will require advancements in error mitigation techniques and more efficient quantum circuit designs to realize the full potential of quantum computing for combinatorial optimization.",

We explore the evolution of the mean position of the quantum walker, denoted as $\\overline{X}(t)$, under various initial conditions of the walker and quantum coin operators. The results indicate a significant dependence of the observed phenomena on the choice of initial state, enabling the selective induction of the quantum boomerang effect in both or only one portion of the wavepacket associated with specific internal states. By varying the quantum coin parameter $\\theta$, we find that the maximum mean position follows a power-law decay near the Pauli-Z coin, characterized by $X_{\\text{Max}} \\sim \\theta^{-2}$. Additionally, we identify a scaling behavior $X_{\\text{Max}} \\sim W^{-2}$, which is consistent with the localization length observed in disordered quantum systems.

Cryptochrome's molecular chirality has been hypothesized to enhance magnetic field effects via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, yet the mechanism underlying this enhancement remains unresolved. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of CISS on the directional magnetic sensitivity of prototypical radical pair reactions, analyzing two distinct models--one generating spin polarization and, for the first time, one generating coherence. We find that CISS-induced spin polarization significantly enhances magnetic sensitivity by introducing triplet character into the initial state and reinforcing the quantum Zeno effect, paralleling enhancements observed in triplet-born radical pairs subject to strongly asymmetric recombination. In contrast, CISS-generated spin coherence does not provide a significant improvement in sensitivity. These findings indicate that CISS is not itself a universal enhancer of sensitivity or coherence in radical-pair reactions, and its influence must be evaluated case by case, particularly in relation to the quantum Zeno effect. Additionally, we provide a unified interpolation scheme for modeling CISS-influenced initial states and recombination dynamics, encompassing the principal models currently discussed in the literature for singlet and triplet precursors.",

Current demonstrations rely on bulk photon-collection and manipulation optics that suffer from environment-induced phase instability, mode matching challenges, and system-to-system variability, factors that impede scaling to the large numbers of entangled pairs needed for quantum information processing. To address these limitations, we demonstrate a collection method that enables passive phase stability, straightforward photonic manipulation, and intrinsic reproducibility. Specifically, we engineer a waveguide-integrated grating to couple photons emitted from a trapped ion into a single optical mode within a microfabricated ion-trap chip. Using the integrated collection optic, we characterize the collection efficiency, image the ion, and detect the ion's quantum state.

Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.

    "summary": "The minimal bound of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is modulated from that of the classical counterpart ($\\mathcal{Q}_{\\rm min}=2$) when a quantumness is present in the dynamical process far from equilibrium. A recent study on a dissipative two-level system (TLS) subject to an external field indicates that quantum coherences can suppress the fluctuations of the irreversible current and loosens the TUR bound to $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\rm min}^{\\rm TLS}\\approx 1.25$. Here, we extend on the field-driven single TLS to a quantum-mechanically coupled two-qubit system (TQS), and explore, in addition to the single qubit coherence, how the quantum coupling between the two qubits affects the photon current, fluctuations, and the TUR bound. We find that the TUR bound of TQS depends on the strength of coupling, such that $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\rm min}^{\\rm TQS}=\\mathcal{Q}_{\\rm min}^{\\rm TLS}\\approx 1.25$ when the two qubits are effectively decoupled under weak coupling, whereas another loose bound $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\rm min}^{\\rm TQS}\\approx 1.36$ is identified for two strongly coupled qubits under strong fields. By contrasting the TQS against two coupled noisy oscillators, we illuminate the quantumness unique to the TQS and its effect on the TUR.",

    "summary": "Quantum multi-particle correlations are one of the most intriguing properties of quantum entanglement, arising from collective entangled states of multiple particles. Svetlichny's inequality (SI) was the first method proposed to test the existence of such correlations. Previous studies have primarily focused on $1/2$-spin particle systems. In this paper, we present a unified scheme that enables the violation of SI in arbitrary non-zero spin particle systems. Specifically, for all fermion systems, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI for any number of particles. For boson systems, when the particle spin $j\\geq2$, our scheme consistently realizes the violation of SI for any number of particles. When the particle spin $j=1$, our scheme can yield SI violation for up to $7$ particles. Furthermore, as the particle spin $j$ approaches infinity, our scheme achieves the maximal quantum violation of SI. To obtain these results, we also prove that the upper bound of Svetlichny's operator within the framework of local hidden variable theory is $\\sqrt{2^{N+1}}$. These findings not only enhance our understanding of quantum correlations across various particle systems but also provide valuable insights for the development of quantum communication protocols that utilize entanglement and non-locality in multi-particle configurations.",

As a result, the two resultant output optical fields exhibit unique spatial distributions, such as crescent and petal shapes, which can be non-synchronously modulated via adjusting the intensity and frequency of the control field. The orbital angular momentum transfer dynamics and multi-angle spatial distribution modulation of the output fields show periodic and non-synchronous characteristics via adjusting the control field due to the optical interference. Thus, this quantum system has great potential as a tunable optical modulator, which holds promise for applications in information technologies involving multi-channel processing and asymmetric tasks, especially in advanced optical modulation and quantum state manipulation in quantum information processing.",

The high degree of bipartite entanglement results from the cancellation of spontaneous emission and subsequent elimination of the associated noise due to the destructive quantum interference between the two spontaneous emission pathways from the upper doublet to each of the two lower levels when the two strong pump fields are tuned to the particular frequencies where quantum interference takes place. This scheme is particularly suitable for the generation of entanglement between two bright light fields, and may find potential applications in realistic quantum information processing.",

Here, we propose an experimental scheme to synthesize non-Abelian gauge fields with a single trapped ion by coupling multiple internal levels and Fock states in its motion via laser fields. In contrast to the Abelian AB caging, we numerically observe that the non-Abelian AB caging occurs either when the interference matrix is nilpotent, or when the initial state is specifically set.

    "summary": "We prove that the quantum measurement process contains the same warping mechanism that occurs in categorical perception, a phenomenon ubiquitous in human perception. This warping causes stimuli belonging to the same category to be perceived as more similar, while stimuli belonging to different categories are perceived as more different. As a result of a detailed study of the quantum measurement using the Bloch representation, we identify the natural metric for pure states, namely the Fubini Study metric, and the natural metric for density states, namely the trace class metric. The warping mechanism of categorical perception is then manifested, when the distances between pure states, playing the role of stimuli for the quantum measurement, are warped into the distances between density states, playing the role of percepts for quantum measurement. We work out the example of a two-dimensional quantum model, a qubit, with 'light' and 'dark' as the two eigenstates, and show how the typical contraction and dilation warping of human perception manifest themselves in this example of the quantum measurement model of light and dark.",

As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multi-photon pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multi-photon-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by both charge- and flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that drive-induced QP generation may impact novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving conditions.",

This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.",

The original algorithm relied on an input state in a uniform superposition of all possible bit strings. However, it is known that other input states can reduce certain Bayesian risks of the final estimate. Here, we derive a method to find the risk-minimizing input state for any risk. These states are represented by an eigenvector of a Toeplitz matrix with elements given by the Fourier coefficients of the loss function of interest. We show that, while the true optimal state does not have a closed form for a general loss function, it is well approximated by a state with a cosine form. When the cosine frequency is chosen appropriately, these states outperform the original QPEA and achieve the optimal theoretical quantum-advantage scaling for three common risks. Furthermore, we prove that the uniform input state is suboptimal for any reasonable loss function.

In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such \"optimistic quantum circuits\" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\\log (n / \\epsilon))$ for tunable error parameter $\\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by $\\epsilon$ on all input states except an $O(\\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\\log n)$ total qubits. Additionally, we apply our reduction technique to yield an approximate QFT with well-controlled error on all inputs; it is the first to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\\log (n/\\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits.

While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von-Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement.

A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.",

We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus.

We take the first steps in connecting these abstract topological quantities to operational interpretations of entanglement in two scenarios. The first is we provide a bound on the Integrated Euler Characteristic defined by Hamilton and Leditzky via an average distillable entanglement, which we develop as a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure studied by A. J. Scott in 2004. This allows us to connect the distance of an error correcting code to the Integrated Euler Characteristic.

In other words, the entanglement distance behavior of the first Betti number $\\beta_1(\\varepsilon)$ allows us to determine if a state is locally equivalent to a GHZ state, potentially providing new verification schemes for highly entangled states.",

In this work, we utilize the multilevel nature of high-$E_J/E_C$ transmons to probe the excited-state dynamics induced by strong drives during readout. With up to 10 resolvable states, we quantify the critical photon number of ionization, the resulting state after ionization, and the fraction of the population transferred to highly excited states. Moreover, using pulse-shaping to control the photon number in the readout resonator in the high-power regime, we tune the adiabaticity of the transition and verify that transmon ionization is a Landau-Zener-type transition.

For small to moderately sized systems, we demonstrate a vectorized GPU implementation of a second-order adjoint method that computes both Hessians and gradients with wall times only marginally more than those required to compute gradients via commonly used first-order adjoint methods. Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.",

    "summary": "Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.",

Classically the particle moves away acceleratingly from the center of potential top. The existing eigenstates must be unstable with imaginary eigenvalues, which characterize the decay rate of states. We solve the Hamiltonian problem of inverted potential well by the algebraic method with imaginary-frequency raising and lowering boson operators similar to the normal oscillator case. The boson number operator is non-Hermitian, while the integer-number eigenvalues are, of course, real. Dual sets of eigenstates, denoted by \"bra\" and \"ket\", are requested corresponding respectively to the complex conjugate number-operators. Orthonormal condition exists between the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states. We derive a spatially non-localized generating function, from which $n$-th eigenfunctions can be generated by the raising operators in coordinate representation. The \"bra\" and \"ket\" generating functions are mutually normalized with the imaginary integration measure. The probability density operators defined between the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states are non-Hermitian invariants, which lead to the Schr\\H{o}dinger equations respectively for the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states. While probabilities of \"bra\" and \"ket\" states themselves are not conserved quantities because of the decay. The imaginary-frequency boson coherent states are defined as eigenstates of lowering operators. The minimum uncertainty relation is proved explicitly in the coherent states. Finally the probability average of Heisenberg equation in the coherent states is shown precisely in agreement with the classical equation of motion. The quantum-classical correspondence exists in the imaginary eigenvalue system.",

Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error in the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code can support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for local erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of the encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the worst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a semidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem, is formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient, ensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with $n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state code, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single subsystem erasure with error probability of $\\varepsilon = 0.005$.

However, the spin and optical properties of NV centers degrade when closer than about 10 nm from the diamond surface, limiting NMR sensitivity as well as spectral and spatial resolution. Here we outline efforts to develop an alternative nanoscale NMR sensor using the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). As a van der Waals material, hBN's surface is free from dangling bonds and other sources of paramagnetic noise that degrade the performance of near surface NVs, allowing stable $V_B^-$ defects to exist $\\sim1\\,$nm from the material surface. We discuss the properties of boron vacancies as they apply to narrowband (AC) magnetic field sensing and outline experimental designs optimized for this system. We propose measurement protocols for $V_B^-$ NMR for both statistically and uniformly polarized samples at the nano- and micron-scales, including relevant pulse sequences, sensitivity calculations, and sample confinement strategies; and compare the expected performance to NV-NMR. We estimate back-action effects between the $V_B^-$ electronic spins and the sample nuclear spins at the nanoscale; and account for unconventional diffusion dynamics in the flow-restricted nanoscale regime, calculating its effects on the expected $V_B^-$ NMR signal.

The Wigner function is a pseudo-probability-distribution (real but not necessarily positive) over phase-space.

The results show that photons detected in equal superpositions of the two paths are delocalized when detected in a high probability output port, and \"super-localized\" when detected in a low probability output port. We can thus confirm that delocalization depends on the detection of photons in the output of the interferometer, providing direct experimental evidence for the dependence of physical reality on the context established by a future measurement.",

Despite this, the limitation of single-crystal NIs to monoenergetic beams significantly reduces neutron flux, making precision gravitational measurements unfeasible. A new NI design called the phase-grating moir\\'{e} interferometer (PGMI) has been shown to increase neutron flux by orders of magnitude while allowing grating separation that maintains similar interferometer area to previous NI devices. Here, we propose and describe an experiment to measure G using the PGMI to a precision comparable to measurements from the CODATA 2022 evaluation. A Monte Carlo model for incorporating nonlinear potentials into a PGMI is introduced. This model is used to evaluate sources of systematic uncertainty and quantify the uncertainty in G arising from these effects. The effect of lunar gravitation on a torsion pendulum experiment from CODATA 2022 is calculated, and the need for possible correction factors is demonstrated. This work demonstrates that a neutron PGMI can be used to measure G to $150$ parts-per-million in the near term with the potential to achieve greater precision in future experimental designs.",

    "summary": "Over the past decade, Rydberg atom electric field sensors have been under investigation as potential alternatives or complements to conventional antenna-based receivers for select applications in RF communications, remote sensing, and precision metrology. To understand the potential utility of these devices for various use cases, it is crucial to develop models that accurately predict key performance metrics such as instantaneous bandwidth and dynamic range. However, existing numerical models require solving a large set of coupled differential equations that is computationally intensive and lengthy to solve. We present an analytic approach that can be used to derive an impulse response function that allows up to two orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared to the full time-dependent integration of the equations of motion. This approach can be used to enable rapid assessments of the Rydberg sensor's response to various waveforms.",

    "summary": "Solving problems related to planning and operations of large-scale power systems is challenging on classical computers due to their inherent nature as mixed-integer and nonlinear problems. Quantum computing provides new avenues to approach these problems. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems which aims at minimizing the total cost while optimally allocating generating units to meet the hourly demand of the power loads. The hybrid algorithm combines a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a classical Bender's type heuristic. The resulting algorithm computes approximate solutions to UC in three stages: i) a collection of UC vectors capable meeting the power demand with lowest possible operating costs is generated based on VQA; ii) a classical sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) routine is leveraged to find the optimal power level corresponding to a predetermined number of candidate vectors; iii) in the last stage, the approximate solution of UC along with generating units power level combination is given. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method, three different systems with 3 generating units, 10 generating units, and 26 generating units were tested for different time periods. In addition, convergence of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for select time periods is proven out on IonQ's Forte system.",

By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude-Lorentzian component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.",

As QISE continues to evolve, engineering will play an increasingly critical role in advancing quantum technologies. While efforts to characterize introductory QISE courses are underway, a comprehensive understanding of QISE education across the United States remains lacking. Developing a broad understanding of the QISE education landscape is crucial for addressing the needs of the growing quantum industry and ensuring equitable access for a diverse range of participants. This paper presents part of an ongoing effort to characterize the current landscape of QISE courses and degree programs in higher education in the US. To achieve this, we used publicly available information from university and college websites to capture information on over 8000 courses that address quantum in some way and nearly 90 QISE specific programs (e.g., degrees, minors, certificates). The majority of these programs are interdisciplinary and include engineering; 14 of them are housed exclusively in engineering departments. We find most programs are offered at research intensive institutions. Our results showcase an opportunity for program developers at non-research intensive institutions to justify the creation of QISE programs, which would also address calls from different stakeholders in QISE education for a more diverse QISE workforce. We suggest strategies based on the findings of this study such as integrating QISE into existing engineering courses, investing in the development of QISE courses and programs at non-PhD-granting institutions, and making courses with QISE content accessible to students from a variety of majors.",

    "summary": "Sampling experiments provide a viable route to show quantum advantages of quantum devices over classical computers in well-defined computational tasks. However, quantum devices such as boson samplers are susceptible to various errors, including stochastic errors due to fabrication imperfections. These cause the implemented unitary operations to deviate randomly from their intended targets, following distributions with finite variance. Whilst full-scale quantum error correction remains challenging in the near term, quantum error mitigation schemes have been devised to estimate expectation values, but it is unclear how these schemes would work for sampling experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that, given access to multiple stochastic unitaries, it is possible to mitigate the effect of these errors in sampling experiments. We adopt the unitary averaging protocol which employs multiple stochastic boson samplers to generate a distribution that approximates the ideal boson sampler distribution as the number of samplers increases. We derive a rigorous upper bound on the trace distance between the output probability distributions induced by invertible vacuum-heralded networks based on the Schur-Weyl duality. This result can be seen concretely as an error mitigation scheme in sampling experiments against stochastic errors. On a broader level, it suggests a path towards understanding error mitigation for sampling experiments and developing analysis tools for photonic circuits incorporating measurements and feed-forward. We further provide other applications of unitary averaging, including its use in implementing the linear combination of unitaries and benchmarking fabrication repeatability in linear optics.",

We present a theory concerning errors in approximating Green's functions using continued fractions when only the first $N$ coefficients are known exactly. Our focus lies on the stitching approximation (also known as the recursion method), wherein truncated continued fractions are completed with a sequence of coefficients for which exact solutions are available. We assume a now standard conjecture about the growth of the Lanczos coefficients in chaotic many-body systems, and that the stitching approximation converges to the correct answer. Given these assumptions, we show that the rate of convergence of the stitching approximation to a Green's function depends strongly on the decay of staggered subleading terms in the Lanczos cofficients. Typically, the decay of the error term ranges from $1/\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ in the best case to $1/\\mathrm{poly}(\\log N)$ in the worst case, depending on the differentiability of the spectral function at the origin. We present different variants of this error estimate for different asymptotic behaviours of the $b_n$, and we also conjecture a relationship between the asymptotic behavior of the $b_n$'s and the smoothness of the Green's function. Lastly, with the above assumptions, we prove a formula linking the spectral function's value at the origin to a product of continued fraction coefficients, which we then apply to estimate the diffusion constant in the mixed field Ising model.",

    "summary": "We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for \"Lipschitz\" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.",

As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states.

These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\\gtrsim 1/\\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths.

    "summary": "Surface codes represent a leading approach for quantum error correction (QEC), offering a path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, efficiently implementing algorithms, particularly using Pauli-based computation (PBC) with lattice surgery, necessitates careful resource optimization. Prior work often employs static layouts and simplified error models. These typically fail to capture the full costs and dynamic nature of active computation, leading to resource bottlenecks and suboptimal architectural designs. To address this, we introduce SPARO. SPARO features a comprehensive logical error model based on a large corpus of numerical simulations encompassing active Pauli-based computation (PBC) operations-including Pauli product measurements (PPMs), idling qubits, and patch rotations. Our numerical models are integrated within an end-to-end compilation pipeline. SPARO analyzes algorithm-specific bottlenecks arising from constraints such as limited routing areas or magic-state factory throughput. SPARO then dynamically allocates available hardware resources, balancing compute, routing, and magic-state distillation, to minimize space-time overhead and logical error rates for specific workloads. Our simulations demonstrate that SPARO effectively identifies critical resource trade-offs. When evaluated on benchmark circuits, SPARO identifies resource configurations achieving up to 51.11% logical error rate reductions for 433-qubit ADDER circuits when compared to state-of-the-art static layouts using an identical total resource budget. This dynamic approach enables effective co-optimization of PBC execution and surface-code architectures, significantly improving overall resource efficiency. SPARO will be open sourced.",

We study strategies for the allocation and placement of erasure qubits through analysis and simulations. We then use the hybrid-erasure architecture to explore the trade-offs between per-qubit cost and key logical performance metrics such as threshold and effective distance in surface code error correction.

While several linear-time decoders for error correction are known, their error-correcting capability is limited to half the minimum distance of the code, whereas erasure correction allows one to go beyond this limit. As in the classical case, stopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders for quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an attractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in conjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity. We also discuss additional techniques including small-set-flip decoding, that can be applied following the peeling operation, to improve decoding performance and their associated complexity.",

Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent.   Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a \"short-lived\" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum \"stateful obfuscation\" scheme (which we term \"RAM obfuscation\").

The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\\hbar\\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \\sim \\hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.",

    "summary": "The Mpemba effect -- where hot systems cool faster than colder ones -- has intrigued both classical and quantum thermodynamics. As compared to classical systems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent works have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several quantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open systems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. However, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath state, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we propose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba effect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown that the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early relaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded thermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial atom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba effect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in thermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering quantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through system-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum thermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information processing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.",

    "summary": "Current advancements in communication equipment demand the investigation of classical information transfer over quantum channels, by encompassing realistic scenarios in finite dimensions. To address this issue, we develop a framework for analyzing classical capacities of quantum channels where the set of states used for encoding information is restricted based on various physical properties. Specifically, we provide expressions for the classical capacities of noiseless and noisy quantum channels when the average energy of the encoded ensemble or the energy of each of the constituent states in the ensemble is bounded. In the case of qubit energy-preserving dephasing channels, we demonstrate that a nonuniform probability distribution based on the energy constraint maximizes capacity, while we derive the compact form of the capacity for equiprobable messages. We suggest an energy-constrained dense coding (DC) protocol that we prove to be optimal in the two-qubit situation and obtain a closed-form expression for the DC capacity. Additionally, we demonstrate a no-go result, which states that when the dimension of the sender and the receiver is two, no energy-preserving operation can offer any quantum advantage for energy-constrained entanglement-assisted capacity. We exhibit that, in the energy-constrained situation, classical-quantum noisy channels can show improved capabilities under entanglement assistance, a phenomenon that is unattainable in the unrestricted scenario.",

    "summary": "Conventionally in quantum sensing, the goal is to estimate one or more unknown parameters that are assumed to be deterministic - that is, they do not change between shots of the quantum-sensing protocol. We instead consider the setting where the parameters are stochastic: each shot of the quantum-sensing protocol senses parameter values that come from independent random draws. In this work, we explore three examples where the stochastic parameters are correlated and show how using entanglement provides a benefit in classification or estimation tasks: (1) a two-parameter classification task, for which there is an advantage in the low-shot regime; (2) an $N$-parameter estimation task and a classification variant of it, for which an entangled sensor requires just a constant number (independent of $N$) shots to achieve the same accuracy as an unentangled sensor using exponentially many (${\\sim}2^N$) shots; (3) classifying the magnetization of a spin chain in thermal equilibrium, where the individual spins fluctuate but the total spin in one direction is conserved - this gives a practical setting in which stochastic parameters are correlated in a way that an entangled sensor can be designed to exploit. We also present a theoretical framework for assessing, for a given choice of entangled sensing protocol and distributions to discriminate between, how much advantage the entangled sensor would have over an unentangled sensor. Our work motivates the further study of sensing correlated stochastic parameters using entangled quantum sensors - and since classical sensors by definition cannot be entangled, our work shows the possibility for entangled quantum sensors to achieve an exponential advantage over classical sensors, in contrast to the typical quadratic advantage.",

While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume. Here, we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold reduction in spatial resolution relative to single NV centers under ambient conditions. The protocol employs carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway toward atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interface.",

In this work, we propose a surface code error-corrected QRAM made of heterogeneous code distance logical qubits. Our QRAM can produce higher fidelity queries, while keeping qubit overheads smaller than the uniformly error-corrected QRAMs. Comparisons between our novel QRAM architectures and a uniformly error corrected baseline are presented, showing that our designs can achieve up to polylogarithmic reduction in query infidelity, producing constant query infidelity scaling, while simultaneously reducing qubit overhead.",

As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps.

Underpinning the core steps of any quantum simulation algorithm, fermion-qubit mappings translate the fermionic interactions to the operators and states of quantum computers. This translation is highly non-trivial: a burgeoning supply of fermion-qubit mappings has arisen over the past twenty years to address the limited resources of early quantum technology. Previous literature has presented a dichotomy between ancilla-free fermion-qubit mappings, which minimise qubit count, and local encodings, which minimise gate complexity.   We present two computational approaches to the construction of general mappings while working with a limited number of qubits, striking a balance between the low-qubit and low-gate demands of present quantum technology. The first method frames the order of fermionic labels as an instance of the quadratic assignment problem to minimize the total and maximum Pauli weights in a problem Hamiltonian. We compare the order-optimized performance of several common ancilla-free mappings on systems of size up to 225 fermionic modes. The second method is a computational approach to incrementally add ancilla qubits to Jordan--Wigner transformations and further reduce the Pauli weights. By adding up to 10 ancilla qubits, we were able to reduce the total Pauli weight by as much as 67% in Jordan--Wigner transformations of fermionic systems with up to 64 modes, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art ancilla-free mappings.

Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy.

    "summary": "Potential Energy Surfaces are generally required for simulating quantum dynamics. Specifically, having an analytical expression of the PES enables a more efficient dynamics workflow compared to the currently popular direct dynamics approaches. When using the MCTDH method, there is also a strong advantage to express the PES in sum-of-products form for solving the time-dependent nuclear Schr\\\"odinger equation. Nevertheless, obtaining an accurate expression for the PES of molecular systems that contain more than a few atoms presents challenges. The objectives of this work are twofold. First, the practicality of a single-layer artificial neural network with sinusoidal activation functions for representing potential energy surfaces in sum-of-products form will be evaluated. Second, the efficiency and ability of a homogeneous sampling strategy based on sparse grids to provide unbiased coverage of configuration space for generating training data will be assessed. The fitting approach, named sinNN, is applied to modeling the PES of HONO, covering both the trans and cis isomers. Refitting is first explored with comparison to the expNN fitting method. Second, fitting from potential energies obtained from the machine learning model MLatom/AIQM2 is considered. The sinNN PES model obtained from MLatom/AIQM2 energies was able to reproduce available experimental fundamental vibrational transition energies with a root mean square error of about 17 cm-1. sinNN combined with sparse grids sampling approach proves to be of practical use for the chosen system, both at refitting and direct fitting tasks. The ability of MLatom/AIQM models to accurately reproduce global PESs beyond equilibrium geometries is of particular interest.",

    "summary": "Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\\Delta| \\gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |110\\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\\sim 1$ GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.",

    "summary": "In the era of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, available quantum resources are limited. Many NP-hard problems can be efficiently addressed using hybrid classical and quantum computational methods. This paper proposes a hybrid variational quantum algorithm designed to solve the $k$-coloring problem of graph vertices. The hybrid classical and quantum algorithms primarily partition the graph into multiple subgraphs through hierarchical techniques. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is employed to determine the coloring within the subgraphs, while a classical greedy algorithm is utilized to find the coloring of the interaction graph. Fixed coloring is applied to the interaction graph, and feedback is provided to correct any conflicting colorings within the subgraphs. The merging process into the original graph is iteratively optimized to resolve any arising conflicts. We employ a hierarchical framework that integrates feedback correction and conflict resolution to achieve $k$-coloring of arbitrary graph vertices. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting the rapid convergence of conflict evolution and the fact that iterative optimization allows the classical algorithm to approximate the number of colorings. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to optimize the scheduling of a subway transportation network, demonstrating a high degree of fairness.",

Here, we develop an accurate semiclassical approach that provides direct and efficient access to the phase-space-resolved quantum Fisher information (QFI), the central quantity that quantifies the ultimate achievable sensitivity. This approximation reveals, in very concrete terms, that the QFI is large whenever a specific dynamical quantity tied to the sensing parameter displays a large variance over the course of the corresponding classical time evolution. Applied to a paradigmatic system of quantum chaos, the kicked top, we show that the semiclassical description is accurate already for modest quantum numbers, i.e. deep in the quantum regime, and extends seamlessly to very high quantum numbers that are beyond the reach of other methods.",

Since a successful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average, such a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep circuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally accessible through the canonical $\\Gamma$-$\\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the optimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized.

QSDC introduces a guess-and-check methodology in which a classical model, powered by either gradient-based neural networks or gradient-free evolutionary strategie, is trained to reconstruct an unknown quantum state using fidelity from the SWAP test as the sole feedback signal. Our approach supports single-copy, mid-circuit state reconstruction, assuming hardware with dynamic circuit support and sufficient coherence time. We validate core components of QSDC both in simulation and on IBM quantum hardware.

Classical homomorphic encryption is lifted to the quantum setting by replacing composite-order groups with Module Learning-With-Errors (MLWE) lattices and by generalizing polynomial functors to bounded natural super functors (BNSFs). A secret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is stored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game that allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid reduction to decisional MLWE.   The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge keeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as controls, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads. Encrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is needed, its axioms are shipped as MLWE \"capsules\"; the evaluator can use them but cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across several QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger.   Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside today's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof runs in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a CCA-level key stays below 300 kB. A photonic Dirac-3 prototype that executes homomorphic teleportation plus knowledge-base-relative amplitude checks appears feasible with current hardware.

Previous models of anyons in one dimension (1D) are mainly categorized into two types: those that rely on nontrivial scattering behavior, and those based on density-dependent hopping processes in discrete lattices. Here, we introduce a novel framework for realizing anyonic correlations using the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor quantum gas. We propose a \"swap\" model, which assigns a complex phase factor to the swapping processes between two different species, referred to as \"host particles\" and \"impurities\". The anyonic characteristics are demonstrated through the one-body correlator of the impurity, using a spin-charge separation analysis. For a single impurity, our swap model can be effectively implemented by applying tilt potentials in a strongly interacting quantum gas [Dhar et al., arXiv:2412.21131]. We further explore the dynamical properties of anyonic correlations and extend our analysis to the case of multiple impurities.

However, this results in a highly irregular graph with many short cycles, leading to poor performance of message-passing algorithms. To compensate, ordered statistics decoding is typically employed, but its cubic complexity renders it impractical for large codes or repeated stabilizer measurements. Our approach instead focuses on estimating the effective data errors caused by hook faults, modeling them as memory channels. We integrate trellis-based soft-input soft-output equalizers into the Tanner graph of the code, and show that the resulting decoding graph preserves the structural properties of the original Tanner graph such as node degree and girth, enabling efficient message passing. Applied to bivariate bicycle quantum LDPC codes, our decoder outperforms standard belief propagation on the circuit-level graph and closely approaches OSD0 performance, all while maintaining linear complexity and scalability.",

But, what exactly should one expect from the Dirac equation? The standard answer would be the Bohr magneton, which is a simple estimate of the electron's spin magnetic moment that can be derived from the Dirac equation either by taking the non-relativistic limit to arrive at the Pauli equation or by examining the Gordon decomposition of the electron's current density. However, these derivations ignore two effects that are central to quantum field theoretic calculations of the electron's magnetic moment: self-interaction and mass renormalization. Those two effects can and should be incorporated when analyzing the Dirac equation, to better isolate the distinctive improvements of quantum field theory. Either of the two aforementioned derivations can be modified accordingly. Doing so yields a magnetic moment that depends on the electron's state (even among $z$-spin up states). This poses a puzzle for future research: How does the move to quantum field theory take you from a state-dependent magnetic moment to a fixed magnetic moment?",

The timeline to useful algorithmic experimentation can be accelerated by techniques that use many noisy shots to produce an accurate estimate of the observable of interest. One such technique is to encode the quantum circuit using an error detection code and discard the samples for which an error has been detected. An underexplored property of error-detecting codes is the flexibility in the circuit encoding and fault-tolerant gadgets, which enables their co-optimization with the algorthmic circuit. However, standard circuit optimization tools cannot be used to exploit this flexibility as optimization must preserve the fault-tolerance of the gadget. In this work, we focus on the $[[k+2, k, 2]]$ Iceberg quantum error detection code, which is tailored to trapped-ion quantum processors. We design new flexible fault-tolerant gadgets for the Iceberg code, which we then co-optimize with the algorithmic circuit for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) using tree search. By co-optimizing the QAOA circuit and the Iceberg gadgets, we achieve an improvement in QAOA success probability from $44\\%$ to $65\\%$ and an increase in post-selection rate from $4\\%$ to $33\\%$ at 22 algorithmic qubits, utilizing 330 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 744 physical two-qubit gates on the Quantinuum H2-1 quantum computer, compared to the previous state-of-the-art hardware demonstration.

Here, we study pure quantum states with controlled multipartite entanglement and show that when entanglement grows with system size $N$, fluctuations in macroscopic observables decay exponentially with $N$, whereas if entanglement remains finite, one recovers only the classical $1/\\sqrt{N}$ suppression. Our work thus provides a quantitative connection between entanglement structure and the emergence of typicality, demonstrating that entanglement is crucial for thermalization in small quantum systems but unnecessary to justify equilibrium in macroscopic ensembles.

Moreover, linear optical platforms preserve some subspaces due to the fixed number of particles during the computation, a property recently exploited to design a novel quantum convolutional neural networks. This last architecture has shown an advantage in terms of running time complexity and of the number of parameters needed with respect to other quantum neural network proposals. In this work, we design and experimentally implement the first photonic quantum convolutional neural network (PQCNN) architecture based on particle-number preserving circuits equipped with state injection, an approach recently proposed to increase the controllability of linear optical circuits. Subsequently, we experimentally validate the PQCNN for a binary image classification on a photonic platform utilizing a semiconductor quantum dot-based single-photon source and programmable integrated photonic interferometers comprising 8 and 12 modes. In order to investigate the scalability of the PQCNN design, we have performed numerical simulations on datasets of different sizes. We highlight the potential utility of a simple adaptive technique for a nonlinear Boson Sampling task, compatible with near-term quantum devices.",

By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models.

    "summary": "The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [$q$-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning; Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We prove worse-case guarantees that significantly improve upon the bounds for previous algorithms. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.",

However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.",

Math. Phys. 62, 022102 (2021)]. In terms of the covariance matrix, our characterization states that an $n$-mode quantum Gaussian state is PUN if and only if its $2n\\times 2n$ quantum covariance matrix $S$ commutes with the standard symplectic matrix $J$. It is well-known that the so-called gauge-invariant Gaussian states are PUN, but whether the converse is true is not known in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We establish the converse in affirmation. Lastly, in terms of the $(A,\\Lambda)$-parameterization, we show that a Gaussian state with parameters $(A,\\Lambda)$ is PUN if and only if $A=0$.",

However, the size of these gaps has to date remained unknown. Here we numerically determine the LHV models maximizing anticorrelations for random axes separated by any fixed angle, by mapping the problem onto ground state configurations of fixed-range spin models. We identify angles where this gap is largest and thus best suited for Bell tests.

The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge regression.

The first one is to consider deterministic processes which are pseudo-random but which have the same characteristics as Nelson's stochastic processes. The second is to consider an extended particle and to represent it by a set of interacting vibrating points.   In a first step, we represent the particle and its evolution by four points that define the structure of a small elastic string that vibrates, alternating at each period a creative process followed by a process of annihilation. We then show how Heisenberg's spin and relations of uncertainty emerge from this extended particle.   In a second step, we show how a complex action associated with this extended particle verifies, from a generalized least action principle, a complex second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We then deduce that the wave function, accepting this complex action as a phase, is the solution to a Schr\\\"odinger equation and that the center of gravity of this extended particle follows the trajectories of de Broglie-Bohm's interpretation.   This extended particle model is built on two new mathematical concepts that we have introduced: complex analytical mechanics on functions with complex values [8, 7, 12] and periodic deterministic processes [8, 9].   In conclusion, we show that this particle model and its associated wave function are compatible with the quantum mechanical interpretation of the double-scale theory we recently proposed [11].",

They hold broad potential for applications in quantum computing and quantum sensing. In this work, we reveal an exact theoretical mechanism governing such non-locally and mesoscopically coupled systems. We demonstrate that the effect of general environments on the system exhibits a universal bosonic character. Specifically, the exact effect that environments have on the system, regardless of their microscopic details, is equivalently produced by the interaction with a reservoir of non-interacting bosonic modes. The emergent 'bosonization' of the environment results from the mesoscopic coupling in the thermodynamic limit and can be interpreted as a manifestation of the central limit theorem. While this effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.",

We introduce a systematic framework for searching codes with specified transversal groups by parametrizing their logical subspaces on the Stiefel manifold and minimizing a composite loss that enforces both the Knill-Laflamme conditions and a target transversal-group structure. Applying this method, we uncover a new $((6,2,3))$ code admitting a transversal $Z\\bigl(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{5}\\bigr)$ gate (transversal group $\\mathrm{C}_{10}$), the smallest known distance $3$ code supporting non-Clifford transversal gates, as well as several new $((7,2,3))$ codes realizing the binary icosahedral group $2I$. We further propose the \\emph{Subset-Sum-Linear-Programming} (SS-LP) construction for codes with transversal \\emph{diagonal} gates, which dramatically shrinks the search space by reducing to integer partitions subject to linear constraints. In a more constrained form, the method also applies directly to the binary-dihedral groups $\\mathrm{BD}_{2m}$. Specializing to $n=7$, the SS-LP method yields codes for all $\\mathrm{BD}_{2m}$ with $2m\\le 36$, including the first $((7,2,3))$ examples supporting transversal $T$ gate ($\\mathrm{BD}_{16}$) and $\\sqrt{T}$ gate ($\\mathrm{BD}_{32}$), improving on the previous smallest examples $((11,2,3))$ and $((19,2,3))$.

However, Heisenberg's proposed back-action uses features that are not present in the QM description of the world, and according to Bohr not present in the world. Therefore, Bohr argues, the mental image proposed by Heisenberg should be avoided. Later developments by Bell and Kochen-Specker shows that a model that contains the features used for the Heisenberg microscope is in principle possible but must necessarily be nonlocal and contextual. In this paper we will re-examine the measurement process within a restriction of QM known as Stabilizer QM, that still exhibits for example Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger nonlocality and Peres-Mermin contextuality. The re-examination will use a recent extension of stabilizer QM, the Contextual Ontological Model (COM), where the system state gives a complete description of future measurement outcomes reproducing the quantum predictions, including the mentioned phenomena. We will see that the resulting contextual Heisenberg microscope back-action can be completely described within COM, and that the associated randomness originates in the initial state of the pointer system, exactly as in the original description of the Heisenberg microscope. The presence of contextuality, usually seen as prohibiting ontological models, suggests that the contextual Heisenberg microscope picture can be enabled in general QM.",

The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.",

    "title": "Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states",
    "summary": "Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\\Delta \\in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.",

Its extension to frequency-dependent matrix-valued functions, recently introduced as the \"analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition\" (ABMD), provides the most general approach for characterizing the driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum optical systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians. In this work, we present a detailed study of the ABMD, focusing on the typical behavior of parameter-dependent singular values and of their corresponding singular vectors. In particular, we analyze the hitherto unexplored occurrence of avoided and genuine crossings in the spectrum of quantum noise, the latter being manifested by nontrivial topological Berry phases of the singular vectors. We demonstrate that avoided crossings arise naturally when a single parameter is varied, leading to hypersensitivity of the singular vectors and suggesting the presence of genuine crossings in nearby systems. We highlight the possibility of programming the spectral response of photonic systems through the deliberate design of avoided crossings. As a notable example, we show that such control can be exploited to generate broad, flat-band squeezing spectra -- a desirable feature for enhancing degaussification protocols.

Conventional quantum reconstruction methods require solving QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problems over full-resolution image grids, which limits scalability under current hardware constraints. Our method addresses this by combining sinogram downscaling with region-wise iterative refinement, allowing reconstruction to begin from a reduced-resolution sinogram and image, then progressively upscaled and optimized region by region. Experimental validation on binary and integer-valued Shepp-Logan phantoms demonstrates accurate reconstructions under both dense and sparsely sampled projection conditions using significantly fewer qubits. We observed that nearest-neighbor interpolation may cause edge artifacts that hinder convergence, which can be mitigated by smoother interpolation and Gaussian filtering. Notably, reconstructing a 500 by 500 image from a 50 by 50 initialization demonstrates the potential for up to 90% reduction in projection data, corresponding to a similar reduction in radiation dose. These findings highlight the practicality and scalability of the proposed method for quantum-enhanced tomographic reconstruction, offering a promising direction for low-dose, high-fidelity imaging with current-generation quantum devices.",

In this manuscript, we introduce the short-time QFT (STQFT) processing technique to bridge this gap in research. We develop a novel overlap-add reconstruction technique in the quantum domain using a permutation gate to combine subsequent windows. With this in mind, we discuss convolution under our novel STQFT processing scheme. We demonstrate filtering in the quantum Fourier domain with a filter stored in a quantum register as well as in a block encoded unitary gate.

Rather than carefully surveying the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we extract an orthodoxy empirically. To do this we review a collection of 33 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy is largely unchanged over the past century, with some interesting emerging deviations, and has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints. However, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense it down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two main pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently changes its state in a random fashion, manifesting in a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.",

For example, nanophotonic platforms can transfer information from the traditional degrees of freedom (DoFs), such as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), to the DoFs of the nanophotonic platform - and back, opening new directions for quantum information processing. Recent experiments have utilized the total angular momentum (TAM) of a photon as a unique means to produce entangled qubits in nanophotonic platforms. Yet, the process of transferring the information between the free-space DoFs and the TAM was never investigated, and its implications are still unknown. Here, we reveal the evolution of quantum information in heralded single photons as they couple into and out of the near-field of a nanophotonic system. Through quantum state tomography, we discover that the TAM qubit in the near-field becomes a free-space qudit entangled in the photonic SAM and OAM. The extracted density matrix and Wigner function in free-space indicate state preparation fidelity above 97%.

A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot.

Notably, we observe that the sudden death of quantum steering is accompanied by a peak in steering asymmetry, signifying a critical transition from two-way steering to one-way steering in the relativistic three-mode system. We find that the Hawking effect can generate inaccessible two-way steering of a bipartite system in both directions, as shown in [Phys. Rev.

Our first main result states that, if the nodal set of the Wigner distribution of a function $f$ is bounded, then $f$ is equal to a generalized Gaussian times a polynomial. An immediate consequence of this result is that any open set is a uniqueness set for Wigner functions with bounded nodal set. Our second main result shows that the only Wigner function vanishing on a circle of radius $\\sqrt{\\hbar/2}$ and centered at the origin is the Wigner distribution of the first Hermite function. We prove similar results for the second and third Hermite functions. We also derive for Wigner functions a counterpart of the sign uncertainty principle of J. Bourgain, L. Clozel and J.-P. Kahane, which says that if the negative part of a Wigner function is contained in a ball, then the radius of the ball has a lower bound. Finally, we obtain various constraints on Wigner distributions whose bounded nodal sets contain circles, ellipses or line segments.

    "summary": "We present an efficient and accurate method for modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in lossy coupled-cavity systems. We apply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal coupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light on-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure coupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square lattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184 non-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is generated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant structure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated entangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant structure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant structure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs remains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our approach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to modeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide variety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.",

We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.

    "summary": "We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.",

Using the framework of quantum Fisher information, many strategies based on squeezed quantum probes and multipath multiphoton or multiqubit entangled states have been considered. In this context there is always the question of what is the simplest measurement that would saturate quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB). The simplest quantity to measure would be characteristics of photon flux or population distribution in case of qubits. Previous studies have shown that the error sensitivity in SU(1,1) interferometry, also known by several other names as nonlinear interferometry, time reversed measurements; does saturate QCRB for single parameters like phase, displacement, loss. In this work we bring out great utility of generalized SU(1,1) interferometry in distributed sensing. The generalized SU(1,1) interferometry is a combination of SU(m) and SU(1,1) elements, where m is the number of nodes in the network. The SU(m) element is used to produce distributed entanglement starting from a squeezed photonic or matter probe. We demonstrate how error sensitivity measurement at just one output port can saturate or nearly saturate QCRB and thus results in Heisenberg sensitivity of network sensing.",

Tomography techniques can provide detailed information on the noise or quality of quantum states but are typically both computationally and experimentally intensive with respect to the system's size. For QEC experiments, however, the information captured by a detector error model is sufficient for extracting the success rate of the experiment, as well as some information about the underlying noise. In this work, we estimate Pauli noise on detector error models, including hypergraphs, using only the syndrome statistics. We apply this method to well-known codes such as the repetition, surface, and 2D color codes. Under bare-ancilla syndrome extraction, two-point correlations are enough to reconstruct the detector error model for repetition or surface codes. For color codes or repetition codes under Steane-style syndrome extraction, we show how to extend the estimation method to multi-point correlators and extract the error rates of the hypergraphs. Finally, we find an increase in logical error suppression when we calibrate the decoder to noise fluctuations typically present in experiments.",

In this work, we develop accurate closed-form approximations for the frequency and anharmonicity of the unimon qubit that are also applicable to any single-mode superconducting qubits with a single-well potential profile, such as the quarton qubit or the kinemon qubit. We use these results to theoretically explore the single-qubit gate fidelity and coherence times across the parameter space of qubits with a single-well potential. We find that the gate fidelity can be optimized by tuning the Hamiltonian to $(i)$ a high qubit mode impedance of $1-2$ $k\\Omega$, $(ii)$ a low qubit frequency of $1$ $GHz$, $(iii)$ and a perfect cancellation of the linear inductance and the Josephson inductance attained at a flux bias of half flux quantum. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed qubit parameters have potential to enhance the single-qubit gate fidelity of the unimon beyond $99.99\\%$ even without significant improvements to the dielectric quality factor or the flux noise density measured for the first unimon qubits.

We show that dynamic scheduling consistently outperforms static scheduling in scenarios with high entanglement parallelism, especially when network resources are scarce. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of communication qubit coherence time, modeled as a cutoff for holding EPR pairs, and demonstrate that aggressive lookahead strategies can degrade performance when coherence times are short, due to premature entanglement discarding and wasted resources. We also identify congestion-free BSM provisioning by profiling peak BSM usage per switch.

In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.",

The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.",

Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) transforms a unitary parameterized by $\\theta$ into one governed by a polynomial function $f(\\theta)$, a feature that underpins key quantum algorithms.

We extend QSP to a new class, non-abelian QSP, which utilizes non-commuting control parameters, $\\hat\\theta_1, \\hat\\theta_2, \\dots$, representing quantum harmonic oscillator positions and momenta. We introduce a fundamental non-abelian composite pulse sequence, the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR), for entangling and disentangling a qubit from an oscillator.

Though quantum fluctuations in the control parameters are unavoidable, the richer commutator algebra of non-abelian QSP enhances its power and efficiency. Non-abelian QSP represents the highest tier of QSP variants tailored for hybrid oscillator-qubit architectures, unlocking new possibilities for such systems. We demonstrate the utility of GCR in high-fidelity preparation of continuous-variable oscillator states, including squeezed, Fock, cat, and GKP states, using fully analytical schemes that match numerically optimized methods in fidelity and depth while enabling mid-circuit error detection.

We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory.

    "summary": "Quantum optimization algorithms, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, are emerging as promising heuristics for solving complex combinatorial problems. To improve performance, several extensions to the standard QAOA framework have been proposed in recent years. Two notable directions include: warm-starting techniques, which incorporate classical approximate solutions to guide the quantum evolution, and custom mixer Hamiltonians, such as XY mixers, which constrain the search to feasible subspaces aligned with the structure of the problem. In this work, we propose an approach that integrates these two strategies: a warm-start initialization with an XY mixer ansatz, enabling constraint-preserving quantum evolution biased toward high-quality classical solutions. The method begins by reformulating the combinatorial problem as a MaxCut instance, solved approximately using the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. The resulting binary solution is relaxed and used to construct a biased superposition over valid one-hot quantum states, maintaining compatibility with the XY mixer's constraints. We evaluate the approach on 5-city instances of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, a canonical optimization problem frequently encountered as a subroutine in real-world Vehicle Routing Problems. Our method is benchmarked against both the standard XY-mixer QAOA and a warm-start-only variant based on MaxCut relaxation. Results show that the proposed combination consistently outperforms both baselines in terms of the percentage and rank of optimal solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining structured initializations with constraint-aware quantum evolution for optimization problems.",

By representing collections of measurements (multimeters) as maps to the set of column-stochastic matrices, we show that measurement compatibility and simulability correspond to specific factorizations of these maps through intermediate systems. We apply this framework to put forward connections between different nonclassical notions and provide factorization-based characterizations for steering assemblages and Bell correlations, including a perspective on the CHSH inequality witnessing measurement incompatibility. Furthermore, we investigate robustness to noise of nonlocal features by examining factorization conditions for maps involving noisy state spaces, providing geometric criteria for when noisy multimeters can be simulated by simpler measurement settings.",

    "summary": "Controlling the charging process of a quantum battery involves strategies to efficiently transfer, store, and retain energy, while mitigating decoherence, energy dissipation, and inefficiencies caused by surrounding interactions. We develop a model to study the charging process of a quantum battery in an open quantum setting, where the battery interacts with a charger and a structured reservoir. To overcome the limitations of static charging protocols, a reinforcement learning (RL) charging strategy is proposed, which utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm alongside long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM networks enable the RL model to capture temporal correlations driven by non-Markovian dynamics, facilitating a continuous, adaptive charging strategy. The RL protocols consistently outperform conventional fixed heuristic strategies by real-time controlling the driving field amplitude and coupling parameters. By penalizing battery-to-charger backflow in the reward function, the RL-optimized charging strategy promotes efficient unidirectional energy transfer from charger to battery, achieving higher and more stable extractable work. The proposed RL controller would provide a framework for designing efficient charging schemes in broader configurations and multi-cell quantum batteries.",

    "summary": "We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.",

This study examines the quantum routines required for the implementation of oracles used in the block-encoding of the $N \\times N$ stiffness and mass matrices, which typically emerge in the finite element analysis of elastic structures. Starting from basic quantum adders, we show how to construct the necessary oracles, which require the calculation of polynomials, square root and the implementation of conditional operations. We propose quantum subroutines based on fixed-point arithmetic that, given an $r$-qubit register, construct the oracle using $\\mathcal{O}((K + L + N_{\\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\\mathrm{D}}) r)$ ancilla qubits and have a $\\mathcal{O}((K + L)r^2 + \\log_2(N_{\\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\\mathrm{D}}))$ runtime, with $K$ the order at which we truncate the polynomials, $L$ the number of iterations in the Newton-Raphson subroutine for the square root, while $N_{\\mathrm{geo}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$ are the number of hypercuboids used to approximate the geometry and the boundary, respectively. Since in practice $r$ scales as $r = \\mathcal{O}(\\log_2 N)$, and assuming that the other parameters are fixed independently of $N$, this shows that the oracles, while still costly in practice, do not endanger potential polynomial or exponential advantages in $N$.",

In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.",

Here we investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that incorporating stochastic noise, specifically noise driven by fractional Brownian motion, in a non-Markovian setup can enhance the performance of adiabatic quantum computing by improving its success probability at limited evolution times. The study begins by developing the mathematical framework to introduce stochastic noise multiplicatively into the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, resulting in a stochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. To preserve It\\^{o} integrability within the non-Markovian framework, a semimartingale approximation for fractional Brownian motion is employed.

Moreover, a critical limitation of the most of the state-of-the-art methods developed to date lies in their substantial reliance on extensive pre-circuit measurements, which introduce significant overheads and contribute to inefficiencies in practical implementation. To address these interconnected challenges and establish a harmonious synergy between them, we propose an algorithmic framework that focuses on efficiently capturing the molecular strong correlation through an ordered set of computationally less demanding rank-one and seniority-zero excitations, yielding a parameterized ansatz with shallow gate depth. Furthermore, to achieve minimal pre-circuit measurement overhead, we implement a selective pruning of excitations through a hybrid approach that combines intuition-based selection with shallow-depth, rank-one excitations driven uni-parameter circuit optimization strategy. With the incorporation of qubit-based excitations via particle-preserving exchange circuits, we demonstrate a further reduction in quantum complexities, enhancing the overall resource efficiency of the approach. With a range of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our dynamic ansatz not only significantly enhances computational efficiency but also delivers exceptional accuracy, robustness, and resilience to the noisy environments inherent in near-term quantum hardware.",

Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of subtle fraud patterns.

However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.",

To substantiate this assertion, we develop a general framework for the characterisation of tripartite correlations by extending the notion of Settings Independence and Outcome Independence beyond their bipartite formulation. This framework highlights the pivotal role of Hardy-type reasoning in the detection and certification of genuine multipartite nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the tripartite Hardy-nonlocality enables the self-testing of a broad class of pure nonmaximally genuine entangled tripartite states. A key advantage of Hardy-based self-testing over methods based on tripartite Bell inequalities is its ability to certify quantum correlations even in the presence of nonmaximal violations. This, in turn, facilitates the device-independent certification of randomness from Hardy-type correlations. Unlike Bell functionals, which typically enable self-testing of only a single extremal point per inequality, Hardy relation self-tests a set of extremal quantum correlations for any nonzero Hardy probability. We find that the maximum certifiable randomness using Hardy-type correlations is $\\log_2 7\\approx 2.8073$-bits, highlighting both the practical and foundational significance of Hardy-based techniques for quantum randomness generation.",

The class polyQCPH is equal to PSPACE with respect to classical oracles, and it is a well-known result that QMA is contained in PSPACE (also with respect to classical oracles).   We also show that the same separation holds relative to a distributional oracle, which is a model introduced by Natarajan and Nirkhe (2024). We believe our findings show the need for some caution when using these non-standard oracle models, particularly when showing separations between quantum and classical resources.",

    "summary": "High-Q nanophotonic resonators are crucial for many applications in classical and quantum optical processing, communication, sensing, and more. We achieve ultra-high quality factors by preparing a highly transparent and strongly dispersive medium within a resonator, causing a reduction in the group velocity that leads to a nearly three order of magnitude increase in the quality factor. We implement this via spectral hole burning in erbium-doped thin-film lithium niobate microring resonators, and show Q-factors exceeding $10^8$. Additionally, we show that the interplay between the spectrally narrowed resonance and the broader bare resonance produces a Fano lineshape, which we dynamically control via electro-optic tuning. Finally, we present a theoretical model for our experimentally observed resonator linewidths, which are not well-described by the standard Bloch equations. Our results show a dramatic reduction in the erbium dephasing rate under a strong optical drive, leading to much narrower linewidths than would otherwise be expected given the large circulating intensity in the resonator.",

We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing holds the potential to provide speedups in solving complex problems that are currently difficult for classical computers. However, the realization of this potential is hindered by the issue of current hardware reliability, primarily due to noise and architectural imperfections. As quantum computing systems rapidly advance, there exists a need to create a generalizable benchmarking tool that can assess reliability across different hardware platforms. In this paper, we introduce GRADE (Grover-based Reliability Assessment for Device Evaluation), an open-source benchmarking toolkit to evaluate the reliability of quantum hardware using a generalized form of Grover's algorithm.   GRADE operates by implementing Grover's algorithm to search through a variety of primitive collections that are customizable by the user, analyzing the probability distribution of the results to assess accuracy and stability. This approach aims to evaluate the hardware performance of Grover's algorithm, which is fundamental in unordered search problems, making it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, as it is one of the few generalizable quantum algorithms that provide a direct speedup. Importantly, GRADE can adapt to a wide range of quantum computing platforms, ensuring it can be applied across different hardware architectures. Additionally, our work provides a scoring function for evaluating the hardware performance for multi-target Grover's implementation. Our work validates this approach across a multitude of simulators and hardware platforms from varying providers, demonstrating its adaptability to differing backend providers.",

Effectively, this setup corresponds to an SU(1,1) interferometer. Here, we aim to provide a thorough theoretical analysis of this technique and the broadband SU(1,1) interferometer in general in terms of its Schmidt modes. Utilizing the joint Schmidt decomposition of the transfer functions, we investigate the shape and the phase profile of the modes of a single parametric down-conversion (PDC) section and a full (in general, unbalanced) SU(1,1) interferometer for different parametric gain regimes. We consider the complicated interplay between the modes, which is reflected in their overlap coefficients, present a rigorous theoretical approach for the aforementioned multimode phase-sensitive amplification technique, and discuss approximations to make this method experimentally feasible.",

Here, we investigate the symplectic rank: a novel non-Gaussianity monotone that satisfies remarkable operational and resource-theoretic properties. Mathematically, the symplectic rank of a pure state is the number of symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix that are strictly larger than the ones of the vacuum. Operationally, it (i) is easy to compute, (ii) emerges as the smallest number of modes onto which all the non-Gaussianity can be compressed via Gaussian unitaries, (iii) lower bounds the non-Gaussian gate complexity of state preparation independently of the gate set, (iv) governs the sample complexity of quantum tomography, and (v) bounds the computational complexity of bosonic circuits. Crucially, the symplectic rank is non-increasing under post-selected Gaussian operations, leading to strictly stronger no-go theorems for Gaussian conversion than those previously known. Remarkably, this allows us to show that the resource theory of non-Gaussianity is irreversible under exact Gaussian operations. Finally, we show that the symplectic rank is a robust non-Gaussian measure, explaining how to witness it in experiments and how to exploit it to meaningfully benchmark different bosonic platforms. In doing so, we derive lower bounds on the trace distance (resp. total variation distance) between arbitrary states (resp. classical probability distributions) in terms of the norm distance between their covariance matrices, which may be of independent interest.",

We map such circuits to a fermionic tensor network and introduce a novel decomposition of non-Matchgate gates into a Gaussian fermionic tensor and a residual quartic term, inspired by interacting fermionic systems. The quartic term is independent of the specific gate, which allows us to precompute intermediate results independently of the exact circuit structure and leads to significant speedups when compared to other methods. Our decomposition suggests a natural perturbative expansion which can be turned into an algorithm to compute measurement outcomes and observables to finite accuracy when truncating at some order of the expansion. For particle number conserving gates, our decomposition features a unique truncation cutoff reducing the computational effort for high precision calculations. Our algorithm significantly lowers resource requirements for simulating parity-preserving circuits while retaining high accuracy, making it suitable for simulations of interacting systems in quantum chemistry and material science. Lastly, we discuss how our algorithm compares to other classical simulation methods for fermionic quantum systems.",

The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.",

However, their practical application is hindered by significant optimization challenges, arising from complex loss landscapes characterized by barren plateaus and numerous local minima. These problems become more severe as the number of parameters or qubits increases, hampering effective training. To mitigate these optimization challenges, particularly for quantum machine learning applied to classical data, we employ an approach of distributing overlapping local patches across multiple quantum neural networks, processing each patch with an independent quantum neural network, and aggregating their outputs for prediction. In this study, we investigate how the number of parameters and patches affects the loss landscape geometry of this distributed quantum neural network architecture via Hessian analysis and loss landscape visualization. Our results confirm that increasing the number of parameters tends to lead to deeper and sharper loss landscapes. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing the number of patches significantly reduces the largest Hessian eigenvalue at minima. This finding suggests that our distributed patch approach acts as a form of implicit regularization, promoting optimization stability and potentially enhancing generalization. Our study provides valuable insights into optimization challenges and highlights that the distributed patch approach is a promising strategy for developing more trainable and practical quantum machine learning models for classical data tasks.",

It is shown here that the hypothesis can be a suitable way to take an expectation value over an equal superposition of eigenstates on the quantum computer. The complexity of taking the expectation value relies on an efficient time-evolution implementation with complexity $O(T)$ where $T$ is the cost of a single time-step going as $O(\\log_2N)$ and sampling at each time step. The resulting algorithm is demonstrated for the expectation value of the inverse of an operator and then generalized to the gradient of a logarithm-determinant. The method scales as $O(\\tau TM/\\varepsilon^3)$ with a factor $M$ relating to the number of digits of precision, $\\varepsilon$, and $\\tau$ the averaging time. This is independent of the condition number of the input operator and does not require a quantum memory. There is a potential for a many-body localized state--which would increase the thermalization time--but many circuits of practical interest are uniform enough to avoid this, and it is also expected that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis holds beyond the currently available system sizes that are studied.

Recent research takes advantage of extended wavelength inside near-zero refractive index media to solve the long-range problem along with less sensitivity on the position of quantum emitters. However, those recent proposals use plasmonic epsilon near-zero waveguides that are intrinsically lossy.

    "summary": "We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the   eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.",

    "summary": "The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\\leq 0.1\\%$.",

Typically, quantum classification algorithms allow us to classify functions with a probability of $1.0$, if we are promised that they meet specific unique properties. The primary objective of this study is to explore whether it is feasible to obtain any insights when the input function deviates from the promised class. For concreteness, we use a recently introduced quantum algorithm that is designed to classify with probability $1.0$ using just a single oracular query a large class of imbalanced Boolean functions. Fist, we establish a completely new concept characterizing ``nearness'' between Boolean function. Utilizing this concept, we show that, as long as the input function is close enough to the promised class, it is still possible to obtain useful information about its behavioral pattern from the classification algorithm. In this regard, the current study is among the first to provide evidence that shows how useful it is to apply quantum classification algorithms to functions outside the promised class in order to get a glimpse of important information.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological fluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between quantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of decoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured with perturbation theory, hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that even though the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, when decoherence takes place, it can always be interpreted as resulting from a locally Markovian process. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.",

    "summary": "Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm for approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by reducing instances of linear satisfiability to bounded-distance decoding over superpositions of quantum states. A central challenge in realizing DQI is the design of a decoder that operates coherently on quantum superpositions. In this work, we present a concrete quantum circuit implementation of DQI, with a focus on the decoding subroutine. Our design leverages a reversible Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit for the decoding stage. We analyze the circuit's depth and gate complexity and validate its performance through simulations on systems with up to 30 qubits. These results establish a concrete foundation for scalable implementations of DQI and open the door to future algorithmic refinements and hardware-level realizations.",

    "summary": "The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\\{O_m \\}_{m\\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\\{O_m \\}_{m\\ge n}$ for $n\\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \\to \\infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\\to\\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.",

    "summary": "Quantum cloud computing is essential for achieving quantum supremacy by utilizing multiple quantum computers connected via an entangling network to deliver high performance for practical applications that require extensive computational resources. With such a platform, various clients can execute their quantum jobs (quantum circuits) without needing to manage the quantum hardware and pay based on resource usage. Hence, defining optimal quantum resource allocation is necessary to avoid overcharging clients and to allow quantum cloud providers to maximize resource utilization. Prior work has mainly focused on minimizing communication delays between nodes using multi-objective techniques. Our approach involves analyzing the problem from a game theory perspective. We propose a quantum circuit partitioning resource allocation game model (QC-PRAGM) that minimizes client costs while maximizing resource utilization in quantum cloud environments. We extend QC-PRAGM to QC-PRAGM++ to maximize local gates in a partition by selecting the best combinations of qubits, thereby minimizing both cost and inter-node communication.   We demonstrate analytically that clients are charged appropriately (with a total cost at most $\\frac{4}{3}$ the optimal cost) while optimizing quantum cloud resources. Further, our simulations indicate that our solutions perform better than traditional ones in terms of the cost per quantum node, total cost, maximum cost, number of partitions, and number of remote gates.",

    "summary": "In recent years, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as one of the most popular algorithms for solving the electronic structure problem on near-term quantum computers. The utility of VQE is often hindered by the limitations of current quantum hardware, including short qubit coherence times and low gate fidelities. These limitations become particularly pronounced when VQE is used along with deep quantum circuits, such as those required by the \"Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles\" (UCCSD) ansatz, often resulting in significant errors. To address these issues, we propose a low-depth ansatz based on parallelized Givens rotations, which can recover substantial correlation energy while drastically reducing circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts for an arbitrary active space (AS). Also, considering the current hardware architectures with low qubit counts, we introduce a systematic way to select molecular orbitals to define active spaces (ASs) that retain significant electron correlation. We validate our approach by computing bond dissociation profiles of water and strongly correlated systems, such as molecular nitrogen and oxygen, across various ASs. Noiseless simulations using the new ansatz yield ground-state energies comparable to those from the UCCSD ansatz while reducing circuit depth by 50-70%. Moreover, in noisy simulations, our approach achieves energy error rates an order of magnitude lower than that of UCCSD. Considering the efficiency and practical usage of our ansatz, we hope that it becomes a potential choice for performing quantum chemistry calculations on near-term quantum devices.",

At low temperatures, the decoherence of an electronic molecular spin can be driven by its interaction with either other electron spins or nuclear spins. Many experimental techniques have been used to prolong the coherence time of molecular qubits, but these efforts have been hampered by the uncertainty about which of the two mechanisms is effectively limiting coherence in different experimental conditions. Here, we use the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE) to simulate the decoherence of two prototypical molecular qubits and quantitatively demonstrate that nuclear spins become the leading source of decoherence only when the electron spin concentration is below 1 mM. Moreover, we show that deuterated samples, much easier to achieve than fully spin-free environments, could achieve record coherence times of 0.1 ms for an electron spin concentration of 0.1 mM. Alternatively, hydrogen-rich molecular crystals with electron spins concentration below 1 mM can still achieve coherence times of 10 ms through dynamical decoupling, showing that the potential of molecular spins for quantum technologies is still untapped.",

We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field.

A central -- and seemingly obvious -- assumption underpinning previous works is that the radiative emission probability is proportional to the internal quantum efficiency. Here, we introduce a stochastic model of the decay dynamics in quantum emitters that disproves this assumption and provides a systematic framework for the development of deterministic quantum light sources. Our model agrees with a wide range of experimental findings, including time-resolved spectroscopy, autocorrelation measurements, and saturation spectroscopy, and it also explains a number of hitherto unexplained experiments. For example, our model shows that above-band continuous-wave excitation selects the exciton transitions with the lowest quantum efficiency, which is of direct importance for photonic quantum technologies relying on aligning nanostructures to emitters. We show that the underlying physics is governed by incoherent trapping of the population in metastable states, which has profound consequences for the physics of quantum emitters.

Furthermore, we show that while relative entropy and robustness meet three fundamental conditions, they are not optimal for quantifying quantum-state texture. Fortunately, we still find that there are several measures that can be used as the measure standard of quantum-state texture. Among them, the trace distance measure and the geometric measure are two good measurement schemes. In addition, the two measures based on Uhlmann's fidelity are experimentally friendly and can serve as an ideal definition of quantum-state texture measures in non-equilibrium situations.

We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a highly effective medium for this purpose, and various hyper-polarization protocols have been developed. Among these, the pulsed polarization (PulsePol) method has been extensively studied due to its robustness against static energy shifts of the electron spin. In this study, we introduce a sequential polarization protocol and identify a series of magic and digital sequences for hyper-polarizing nuclear spins. Notably, we demonstrate that some of these magic sequences exhibit significantly greater robustness compared to the PulsePol protocol in the presence of finite half $\\pi$ pulse duration of the protocol. This enhanced robustness positions our protocol as a more suitable candidate for hyper-polarizing nuclear spins species with large gyromagnetic ratios and also ensures better compatibility with high-efficiency readout techniques at high magnetic fields.

Our framework utilizes optimistic purification performed directly on the half-RGS primitives across long distances without waiting for heralding outcomes. The overhead is modest: the RGS generation slows down proportionally with the number of purification rounds, and each round requires only one additional quantum emitter per half-RGS source. However, since the generation time is negligible compared to the end-to-end communication delay, the total latency remains effectively dominated by communication time, similar to frameworks without purification. Our framework enables flexible purification scheduling along the connection path, making it compatible with memory-based strategies, a rich body of research on purification scheduling and optimization that was previously thought inapplicable to the RGS scheme.

    "summary": "Quantum resources enable secure quantum sensing (SQS) of remote systems, offering significant advantages in precision and security. However, decoherence in the quantum communication channel and during the evolution of quantum states can erode these advantages. In this work, we first propose a general $N-$particle scheme that achieves Heisenberg-limited (HL) scaling for single-parameter estimation in the presence of an ideal quantum communication channel and encoding scenario. For non-ideal dynamics, we introduce a modified protocol incorporating local quantum optimal control (QOC) operations to address noise in SQS under generalized Pauli dephasing and parallel dephasing noise. We analyze two distinct scenarios: a noiseless communication channel with noisy evolution, and a noisy communication channel with noisy evolution. For the noisy channel, we model the link between the communicating parties as a depolarizing channel. The protocol leverages QOC operations to actively mitigate noise, enhancing the achievable quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the classical Fisher information (CFI) based on the chosen measurement strategy.",

    "summary": "Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers which can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the magic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide efficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy which robustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic monotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably distinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We apply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of noise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally verify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that magic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing that subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite entanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography and pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible, one requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a necessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful tools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.",

    "title": "Quantum Circuit Learning Using Non-Integrable System Dynamics",
    "summary": "Quantum machine learning is an approach that aims to improve the performance of machine learning methods by leveraging the properties of quantum computers. In quantum circuit learning (QCL), a supervised learning method that can be implemented using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), the process of encoding input data into quantum states has been widely discussed for its important role on the expressive power of learning models. In particular, the properties of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian used for encoding significantly influence model performance. Recent encoding methods have demonstrated that the expressive power of learning models can be enhanced by applying exponentially large magnetic fields proportional to the number of qubits. However, this approach poses a challenge as it requires exponentially increasing magnetic fields, which are impractical for implementation in large-scale systems. Here, we propose a QCL method that leverages a non-integrable Hamiltonian for encoding, aiming to achieve both enhanced expressive power and practical feasibility. We find that the thermalization properties of non-integrable systems over long timescales, implying that the energy difference has a low probability to be degenerate, lead to an enhanced expressive power for QCL. Since the required magnetic field strength remains within a practical range, our approach to using the non-integrable system is suitable for large-scale quantum computers. Our results bridge the dynamics of non-integrable systems and the field of quantum machine learning, suggesting the potential for significant interdisciplinary contributions.",

It can closely follow the designed nonadiabatic passage during the time evolution and avoid the unwanted transition by imposing the path-dependent and fast-varying global phase. A general GHZ state of $N$ Rydberg qubits can be prepared in $N-1$ steps, which is found to be robust against both environmental noises and systematic errors. Our protocol therefore provides an avenue towards large-scale entanglement, which is essential for quantum information and quantum computation based on neutral atoms.",

In this paper, we study the activation of hidden nonlocality and preparation contextuality for a class of mixed entangled states, using local filtering operations. For our demonstration, we consider the two-party (Alice and Bob) one-way communication game known as parity oblivious random access code (PORAC). The quantum success probability of such $n$-bit PORAC solely depends on a Bell functional involving $2^{n-1}$ and $n$ dichotomic measurement settings for Alice and Bob, respectively. Such a Bell functional has two classical bounds, the local and the preparation non-contextual. We show that using local filtering operations on local mixed entangled state, the nonlocality can be revealed for any non-zero value of the mixedness parameter of the entangled state if $n\\geq6$. Further, we show that the preparation contextuality, which is a comparatively weaker quantum correlation than nonlocality, can be revealed for any non-zero value of the mixedness parameter of the entangled state if $n\\geq 4$.",

    "summary": "Multiparameter quantum estimation theory is crucial for many applications involving infinite-dimensional Gaussian quantum systems, since they can describe many physical platforms, e.g., quantum optical and optomechanical systems and atomic ensembles. In the multiparameter setting, the most fundamental estimation error (quantified by the trace of the estimator covariance matrix) is given by the Holevo Cram\\'er-Rao bound (HCRB), which takes into account the asymptotic detrimental impact of measurement incompatibility on the simultaneous estimation of parameters encoded in a quantum state. However, the difficulty of evaluating the HCRB for infinite-dimensional systems weakens the practicality of applying this tool in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an efficient numerical method to evaluate the HCRB for general Gaussian states, by solving a semidefinite program involving only the covariance matrix and first moment vector and their parametric derivatives. This approach follows similar techniques developed for finite-dimensional systems, and hinges on a phase-space evaluation of inner products between observables that are at most quadratic in the canonical bosonic operators. From this vantage point, we can also understand symmetric and right logarithmic derivative scalar Cram\\'er-Rao bounds under the same common framework, showing how they can similarly be evaluated as semidefinite programs. To exemplify the relevance and applicability of this methodology, we consider two paradigmatic applications, where the parameter dependence appears both in the first moments and in the covariance matrix of Gaussian states: estimation of phase and loss, and estimation of squeezing and displacement.",

Statistical noise inevitably arises in real settings of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) due to the practical necessity of taking a small to moderate number of measurements. We investigate the effect of statistical noise in spin-network QRC on the possible performance benefits conferred by quantumness. As our measures of quantumness, we employ both quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose of the density matrix, and coherence, which we quantify as the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We find that reservoirs which enjoy a finite degree of quantum entanglement and coherence are more stable against the adverse effects of statistical noise on performance compared to their unentangled, incoherent counterparts. Our results indicate that the potential benefit reservoir computers may derive from quantumness depends on the number of measurements used for training and testing, and may indeed be enhanced by statistical noise.

    "summary": "Counterdiabatic driving emerges as a valuable technique for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, enhancing quantum technology applications. In this context, counterdiabatic quantum computing represents a new paradigm with the potential to achieve quantum advantage for industrial problems. This work investigates the production of quantum coherence in adiabatic evolution accelerated by counterdiabatic driving within the framework of counterdiabatic quantum computing. Specifically, we analyze different orders in the nested commutator expansion for approximated counterdiabatic drivings for three cases: a weighted max-cut problem, a 4-local Hamiltonian, and a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that the hierarchy introduced by coherence production correlates with the success probability in the impulse regime. This suggests that protocols increasing coherence during evolution enhance performance in adiabatic evolution driven by counterdiabatic techniques. We show that large quantum coherence also means large energy fluctuation during evolution, which is associated with the speed of evolution, paving the way for designing superior algorithms in counterdiabatic quantum computing.",

    "summary": "Tailoring energy levels in quantum systems via Hamiltonian control parameters is essential for designing quantum thermodynamic devices and materials. However, conventional methods for manipulating finite-size systems, such as tuning external fields or system size, typically lead to uniform spectral shifts, limiting precise control. A recently introduced technique, called the size-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new control parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system size, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to quantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum size effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the minimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a two-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape effects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature absent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the origin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state energy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to many-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state energy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing energy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under quasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce thermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems. Our results offer a broadly applicable route to spectral gap control in quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Kinetically constrained models were originally introduced to capture slow relaxation in glassy systems, where dynamics are hindered by local constraints instead of energy barriers. Their quantum counterparts have recently drawn attention for exhibiting highly degenerate eigenstates at zero energy -- known as zero modes -- stemming from chiral symmetry. Yet, the structure and implications of these zero modes remain poorly understood. In this work, we focus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically constrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry. We use the $U(1)$ East, which lacks inversion symmetry, and the inversion-symmetric $U(1)$ East-West models to illustrate our two main results. First, we observe that the simultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a parametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the many-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the concept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce the notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for their existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central role, and demonstrate bound states in both example models. Our results motivate a systematic study of bound states and their relation to ergodicity breaking, transport, and other properties of quantum kinetically constrained models.",

With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters.

It is herein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without noise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant universal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits. Well-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and post-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols non-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1 MSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a coherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform individual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the price of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(p^2)$. Our technique can be applied to any MSD protocol with an acceptance rate of 1 in the absence of noise. It may be desirable to use our scheme if the coherent feedback network can be executed faster and more reliably than the measurements and/or if logical clock cycles in the quantum processor should be kept synchronous at all times. Our result broadens the path of potential experimental realizations of MSD in near-term devices and advances the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with practical use.",

Majorana-based tetron qubits are predicted to exhibit error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and length of each topological superconducting wire in the tetron. In contrast to this prediction, we show that errors arising from small variations in the chemical potential grow linearly with tetron length at zero temperature. These errors stem from leakage into excited quasiparticle states, which ultimately poison Majorana modes at opposite ends of the tetron, causing errors. We further demonstrate that the dynamics of this leakage is captured by the half Landau-Zener effect, which dictates its dependence on key system parameters such as the superconducting gap, chemical potential variations, and dynamic changes in the spatial profile of Majorana modes. These results motivate further investigations into the impact of leakage on qubit performance and potential mitigation strategies.",

    "summary": "Broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in quantum information science and technology. Impedance-engineered resonator-based PAs and traveling-wave PAs are the primary approaches to overcome the gain-bandwidth constraint. While the former PAs are simpler to fabricate, the target characteristic impedance Z_\\text{NR} of the nonlinear resonator has been restricted to be below 10 \\Omega, requiring large capacitance. Moreover, these PAs have only been implemented with aluminum-based Josephson junctions (JJs), hindering their operation at high temperatures or strong magnetic fields. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage impedance-transformer scheme, showcased with a 20-nm-thick, 250-nm-wide high-kinetic-inductance niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN) film. Our scheme enables Z_\\text{NR} up to several tens of ohms--a tenfold improvement over conventional designs, achieved through an additional quarter-wavelength transmission line with the characteristic impedance of 180 \\Omega. Our kinetic-inductance impedance-engineered parametric amplifiers (KIMPA), featuring a 330-fF shunt capacitor, demonstrate a phase-preserving amplification with a 450-MHz bandwidth at 17-dB gain, and an added noise ranging from 0.5-1.3 quanta near the center frequency of 8.4 GHz. Due to the high critical current of the NbTiN nanowire, the KIMPA also achieves a saturation power of up to -68\\pm3 dBm, approximately 30-dB higher than that of JJ-based PAs. This scheme also opens new possibilities for other three-wave-mixing building blocks.",

A single-frequency, off-resonant microwave field allows for the suppression of the differential Zeeman shift arising from the nuclear magnetic moment to at least first order. The field dependence can be suppressed further with additional dressing fields, which we demonstrate experimentally with two microwave frequencies. The engineered transition can thus be used in a range of cold atom schemes that rely on coherent state superpositions.",

    "summary": "We propose a novel modular debiasing technique applicable to any discrete random source, addressing the fundamental challenge of reliably extracting high-quality randomness from inherently imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating functions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$. A key theoretical result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common in physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of convergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, strong theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), offering an efficient method for extracting high-quality randomness resilient to experimental imperfections.

In such schemes, continuous monitoring of the quantum system which encodes the parameters of interest, gives rise to different quantum trajectories conditioned on the measurement outcomes which carry information on the parameters themselves. Importantly, different trajectories carry different amount of information i.e they are more or less sensitive to the unknown parameters of interest. In this work, we propose a novel approach on how to systematically engineer the quantum open-system dynamics in order to increase the probability of obtaining trajectories of high sensitivity. We focus on the simplest case scenario of a single two level system interacting with ancillas which are in turn measured consisting the discretized version of continuous monitoring. We analyze the performance of our protocol and demonstrate that it may lead to a substantial enhancement of sensitivity, as quantified by the classical Fisher information, even when applied to such small system sizes, holding the promise of direct implementation to state-of-the-art experimental platforms and to large, complex many-body systems.",

However, compilers on previous IRs lacks the adaptability to the resource constraint in photonic quantum computers. In this work, we propose a novel IR with new optimization passes. Based on this, it realizes a resource-adaptive compiler that minimizes the required hardware size and execution time while restricting the requirement for fusion devices within an adaptive limit.

    "summary": "Current quantum processors are fragile, noisy and fairly limited in both quantity and quality with tens of qubits and physical error rates of around 10^-3. To realize practical quantum applications, however, error rates need to be below 10^-15 across millions of qubits. To bridge this gap and fully harness the potential of quantum computers, quantum error correction (QEC) is essential. QEC codes are designed to protect quantum information by redundantly encoding it onto multiple physical qubits. This encoding allows for the detection and correction of local errors affecting individual qubits, e.g., through stabilizer measurements. Importantly, if the physical error rates are below a specific threshold, QEC codes can exponentially suppress logical error rates by increasing the number of physical qubits involved. This is essential for achieving fault-tolerant computations, which are key to unlocking the full potential of quantum computers. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the implementation and optimization of small-scale QEC experiments using the surface code and flux-tunable superconducting qubits (Transmons). It addresses several key challenges: enhancing two-qubit gate fidelity in Surface-4 (Chapter 2), implementing an error-detection code with Surface-7 (Chapter 3), automating the calibration and benchmarking of the building blocks in Surface-17 (Chapter 4), reducing leakage into higher excited states with leakage reduction units (Chapter 5), assessing and enhancing the performance of logical qubits (Chapters 7 and 8).",

While quantum memory decoding has been well-studied, inevitable correlated errors introduced by entangling logical gates prevent the straightforward generalization of quantum memory decoders. We introduce a data-centric modular decoder framework, Multi-Core Circuit Decoder (MCCD), consisting of decoder modules corresponding to each logical operation supported by the quantum hardware. The MCCD handles both single-qubit and entangling gates within a unified framework. We train MCCD using mirror-symmetric random Clifford circuits, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn correlated decoding patterns. Through extensive testing on circuits significantly deeper than those used in training, we show that MCCD maintains high logical accuracy while exhibiting competitive polynomial decoding time across increasing circuit depths and code distances. When compared with conventional decoders like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), Most Likely Error (MLE), and Belief Propagation with Ordered Statistics Post-processing (BP-OSD), MCCD achieves competitive accuracy with substantially better time efficiency, particularly for circuits with entangling gates. Our approach represents a noise-model agnostic solution to the decoding challenge for deep logical quantum circuits.",

Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.",

We certify the emergent quantum randomness using the frame potential and establish a mapping between its behavior and the statistical mechanics of a domain wall particle model. In both architectures, the effect of quantum measurements induces a nontrivial confinement mechanism, where domain walls are either trapped by an external potential or bound in pairs to form meson-like excitations.

These DM candidates are typically said to behave \"classically\". More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.",

A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation.

In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.",

When instantiated with the Keccak permutation, the sponge forms the NIST SHA-3 standard. SHA-3 is a core component of most post-quantum public-key cryptography schemes slated for worldwide adoption.   While one can consider many security properties for the sponge, the ultimate one is indifferentiability from a random oracle, or simply indifferentiability. The sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni et al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.   In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting.

Several alternative formulations of quantum mechanics using real numbers have been proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate that standard quantum mechanics, formulated in a complex Hilbert space, admits an equivalent reformulation in a real Kahler space. By establishing a natural isomorphism between the operator theories of the complex Hilbert space and the real Kahler space, we prove the equivalence of the two formulations including composite system.   This Kahler-space framework preserves all essential features of quantum mechanics while offering a key advantage: it inherently incorporates a Hamiltonian symplectic structure analogous to classical mechanics.

In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.",

    "title": "Beating the break-even point with autonomous quantum error correction",
    "summary": "Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing, as it protects fragile quantum information from errors by encoding it in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Conventional QEC protocols typically require repeated syndrome measurements, real-time feedback, and the use of multiple physical qubits for encoding. Such implementations pose significant technical complexities, particularly for trapped-ion systems, with high demands on precision and scalability. Here, we realize autonomous QEC with a logical qubit encoded in multiple internal spin states of a single trapped ion, surpassing the break-even point for qubit lifetime. Our approach leverages engineered spin-motion couplings to transfer error-induced entropy into motional modes, which are subsequently dissipated through sympathetic cooling with an ancilla ion, fully eliminating the need for measurement and feedback. By repetitively applying this autonomous QEC protocol under injected low-frequency noise, we extend the logical qubit lifetime to approximately 11.6 ms, substantially outperforming lifetime for both the physical qubit ($\\simeq$0.9 ms) and the uncorrected logical qubit ($\\simeq$0.8 ms), thereby beating the break-even point with autonomous protection of quantum information without measurement or post-selection. This work presents an efficient approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing that harnesses the intrinsic multi-level structure of trapped ions, providing a distinctive path toward scalable architectures and robust quantum memories with reduced overhead.",

Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework allows us to preserve the TTN structure upon application of gates. To benchmark the method, we simulate random and QAOA circuits with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that TTNs provide a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.",

Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state",

Second, our study shows that the diagonal configuration on a two-dimensional lattice, which is exceptional in the case without long-range edges, no longer remains an exceptional configuration. Third, it is also shown that a recently proposed modified coin can search all these configurations, including any other configurations in one- and two-dimensional lattices with very high success probability. Additionally, we construct stationary states for the exceptional configurations caused by the additional long-range edges, which explains why the standard and lackadaisical quantum walks with the Grover coin cannot search these configurations.",

Even for a fixed problem, the number of possible transformation paths -- from industry-relevant formulations through binary constrained linear programs (BILPs), to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and finally to a hardware-executable representation -- is remarkably large. Each step introduces free parameters, such as Lagrange multipliers, encoding strategies, slack variables, rounding schemes or algorithmic choices -- making brute-force exploration of all paths intractable. In this work, we benchmark a representative subset of these transformation paths using a real-world industrial production planning problem with industry data: the optimization of work allocation in a press shop producing vehicle parts. We focus on QUBO reformulations and algorithmic parameters for both quantum annealing (QA) and the Linear Ramp Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (LR-QAOA). Our goal is to identify a reduced set of effective configurations applicable to similar industrial settings. Our results show that QA on D-Wave hardware consistently produces near-optimal solutions, whereas LR-QAOA on IBM quantum devices struggles to reach comparable performance. Hence, the choice of hardware and solver strategy significantly impacts performance. The problem formulation and especially the penalization strategy determine the solution quality. Most importantly, mathematically-defined penalization strategies are equally successful as hand-picked penalty factors, paving the way for automated QUBO formulation.

It is demonstrated that when a photon possessing OAM of 1 interacts with GWs, it may relinquish its OAM and produce a central signal that may be detected. The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in the low-frequency range ($<1$ Hz), opens a potential window to identify GWs in the mid-frequency range ($1\\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary GW detectors, and establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the high-frequency range ($>10$ Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector parameters to focus on specific GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise, and the detectable photon count rate is proportional to the square of the GW amplitude, making it more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors.

In an illustrative application, a discrete version of conventional Hamiltonian $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$ with complex local $V(x) \\neq V^*(x)$ is considered. The numerical MCF convergence is found quick, supported also by a fixed-point-based formal proof.",

    "title": "Public-Key Quantum Fire and Key-Fire From Classical Oracles",
    "summary": "Quantum fire was recently formalized by Bostanci, Nehoran and Zhandry (STOC 25). This notion considers a distribution of quantum states that can be efficiently cloned, but cannot be converted into a classical string. Previously, work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 24) showed how to construct quantum fire relative to an inefficient unitary oracle. Later, the work of Bostanci, Nehoran, Zhandry gave a candidate construction based on group action assumptions, and proved the correctness of their scheme; however, even in the classical oracle model they only conjectured the security, and no security proof was given.   In this work, we give the first construction of public-key quantum fire relative to a classical oracle, and prove its security unconditionally. This gives the first classical oracle seperation between the two fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are equivalent in the information-theoretic setting: no-cloning and no-telegraphing.   Going further, we introduce a stronger notion called quantum key-fire where the clonable fire states can be used to run a functionality (such as a signing or decryption key), and prove a secure construction relative to a classical oracle. As an application of this notion, we get the first public-key encryption scheme whose secret key is clonable but satisfies unbounded leakage-resilience (Cakan, Goyal, Liu-Zhang, Ribeiro [TCC 24]), relative to a classical oracle. Unbounded leakage-resilience is closely related to, and can be seen as a generalization of the notion of no-telegraphing.   For all of our constructions, the oracles can be made efficient (i.e. polynomial time), assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions.",

    "summary": "Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.",

To diversify the training circuits and ensure their quality, we have generated a synthetic dataset using the adaptive QAOA approach, a method that incrementally builds and optimizes problem-specific circuits. The experiments conducted on a curated set of graph instances demonstrate that QAOA-GPT, generates high quality quantum circuits for new problem instances unseen in the training as well as successfully parametrizes QAOA. Our results show that using QAOA-GPT to generate quantum circuits will significantly decrease both the computational overhead of classical QAOA and adaptive approaches that often use gradient evaluation to generate the circuit and the classical optimization of the circuit parameters.

In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

    "summary": "The emergence of classical behavior from quantum mechanics as Planck's constant $\\hbar$ approaches zero remains a fundamental challenge in physics [1-3]. This paper introduces a novel approach employing deep neural networks to directly learn the dynamical mapping from initial quantum state parameters (for Gaussian wave packets of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator) and $\\hbar$ to the parameters of the time-evolved Wigner function in phase space [4-6]. A comprehensive dataset of analytically derived time-evolved Wigner functions was generated, and a deep feedforward neural network with an enhanced architecture was successfully trained for this prediction task, achieving a final training loss of ~ 0.0390. The network demonstrates a significant and previously unrealized ability to accurately capture the underlying mapping of the Wigner function dynamics. This allows for a direct emulation of the quantum-classical transition by predicting the evolution of phase-space distributions as $\\hbar$ is systematically varied. The implications of these findings for providing a new computational lens on the emergence of classicality are discussed, highlighting the potential of this direct phase-space learning approach for studying fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.

A key near-term goal is to build a system capable of executing millions of logical operations reliably -- referred to as a megaquop quantum computer (MQC). In this work, we propose a novel system architecture targeting MQC on trapped-ion quantum computers (TIQC), leveraging their ultra-high-fidelity single-qubit gates (1Q) and efficient two-qubit (2Q) logical CNOT gates enabled by the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture with the ion shuttling feature.   We propose Flexion, a hybrid encoding scheme that uses bare qubits for 1Q gates and QEC-encoded logical qubits for 2Q gates. This approach avoids fully encoding all qubits, eliminating the overhead of gate synthesis, teleportation, and magic state distillation for non-Clifford gates. To support this, we design (1) a low-noise conversion protocol between bare and logical qubits, (2) a bare-logical hybrid instruction set architecture tailored for 2D grid-based TIQC, and (3) a compiler that minimizes conversion cost and optimizes the scheduling efficiency. We evaluate our approach on VQA and small-scale FTQC benchmarks, showing that it achieves superior performance improvements with significantly reduced resource overhead, offering a practical path toward early FTQC on TIQC.",

It is of ongoing interest to develop methods for effectively searching for rare events. With the advent of quantum computing and its potential advantages over classical computing for applications like sampling certain probability distributions, the question arises whether quantum computers could also provide an advantage or inspire new methods for sampling the statistics of rare events. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method for studying rare dynamics, and we investigate their benefits over classical approaches based on neural networks. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrate that our QRL agents can learn and generate the rare dynamics of random walks, and we are able to explain this success as well as the different contributing factors to it via the intrinsic Fourier features of the parameterized quantum circuit. Furthermore, we show better learning behavior with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches. This is the first investigation of QRL applied to generating rare events and suggests that QRL is a promising method to study their dynamics and statistics.",

    "summary": "In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.",

Let $ f(z) $ be a holomorphic function, and let $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denote the inner product defined over an analytic Hilbert space equipped with a Gaussian measure. The derivatives $ f^{(n)}(z) $ at a point $ z_0 $ can be computed theoretically by evaluating an inner product of the form $ f^{(n)}(z_0) = \\frac{\\langle z^n, f(z) \\rangle}{C}, $ where $ C $ is a normalization constant. Specifically, in the Bargmann space (the analytic Hilbert space with a Gaussian weight and orthogonal monomials), this constant is $ \\pi $. This result assumes that $ f(z) $ is a holomorphic function of a single complex variable. The accuracy of the computed derivative values depends on the precision and reliability of the numerical routines used to evaluate these inner products.   The projection coefficients offer valuable insights into certain properties of analytic functions, such as whether they are odd or even, and whether the $ n $-th derivatives exist at a given point $ z_0 $. Due to its relevance to quantum theory, our approach establishes a correspondence between quantum circuits derived from quantum systems and the theory of analytic functions. This study lays the groundwork for further applications in numerical analysis and approximation theory within Hilbert spaces equipped with Gaussian measures.

Here, injection locking of a Rydberg DTC is demonstrated using a radio-frequency (RF) electric field that gradually pulls the intrinsic oscillation toward the injected frequency. Above a critical threshold, full synchronization occurs, with the locking bandwidth scaling linearly with RF amplitude. This includes synchronization of higher-order harmonics, revealing entrainment of the system nonlinear temporal dynamics. The phenomenon parallels injection locking in classical nonlinear systems, but emerges here in a strongly interacting quantum medium.

In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse the direction before reaching the horizon.

We construct a minimal extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows isolated, macroscopic systems to thermalize, with an objective notion of thermalization. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physicality constraints including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium statistics. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum to classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems.

Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity.

    "summary": "Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.",

By integrating shadow tomography into the NOQE, the measurement cost scales linearly rather than quadratically with the number of reference states, while also reducing the required qubits and circuit depth by half. This approach enables extraction of all matrix elements via randomized measurements and classical postprocessing. We analyze its sample complexity and show that, for small systems, it remains constant in the high-precision regime, while for larger systems, it scales linearly with the system size. We further apply shadow-based error mitigation to suppress noise-induced bias without increasing quantum resources. Demonstrations on the hydrogen molecule in the strongly correlated regime achieve chemical accuracy under realistic noise, showing that our method is both resource-efficient and noise-resilient for practical quantum chemistry simulations in the near term.",

However, the system dynamics is typically described by a radiation pressure force treatment in which the frequency shift is expanded stopping at first order in the membrane displacements. In this paper, we study the full dynamics of the system obtained by considering the exact nonlinear dependence of the optomechanical interaction between two membranes' vibrational modes and the driven cavity mode. We then compare this dynamics with the standard treatment based on the Hamiltonian linear interaction, and we find the conditions under which the two dynamics may significantly depart from each other. In particular, we see that a parameter regime exists in which the customary first-order treatment provides distinct and incorrect predictions for the synchronization of two self-sustained mechanical limit-cycles, and for Gaussian entanglement of the two membranes in the case of two-tone driving.",

    "summary": "The most general examples of quantum learning advantages involve data labeled by cryptographic or intrinsically quantum functions, where classical learners are limited by the infeasibility of evaluating the labeling functions using polynomial-sized classical circuits. While broad in scope, such results reveal little about advantages arising from the learning process itself. In cryptographic settings, further insight is possible via random-generatability - the ability to classically generate labeled data - enabling hardness proofs for identification tasks, where the goal is to identify the labeling function from a dataset, even when evaluation is classically intractable. These tasks are particularly relevant in quantum contexts, including Hamiltonian learning and identifying physically meaningful order parameters. However, for quantum functions, random-generatability is conjectured not to hold, leaving no known identification advantages in genuinely quantum regimes.   In this work, we give the first proofs of quantum identification learning advantages under standard complexity assumptions. We confirm that quantum-hard functions are not random-generatable unless BQP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, ruling out cryptographic-style data generation strategies. We then introduce a new approach: we show that verifiable identification - solving the identification task for valid datasets while rejecting invalid ones - is classically hard for quantum labeling functions unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we show that, for a broad class of tasks, solving the identification problem implies verifiable identification in the polynomial hierarchy. This yields our main result: a natural class of quantum identification tasks solvable by quantum learners but hard for classical learners unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy.",

In essence, the considered scheme is an extension of the existing single-photon detector - a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM) - an absorbing microwave detector based on a capacitively-shunted rf SQUID. To implement a two-photon threshold detector, we utilize a dimer of resonators - two lumped-element resonators interacting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively coupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the external flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a non-perturbative two-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the coherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in another resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least two photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand \\textit{in situ} switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the modified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate that, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than $99\\%$ fidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns. The considered scheme may serve as a building block for the implementation of efficient photon-number-resolving detectors in circuit QED architecture.",

While DVR has been extensively used in classical simulations, its quantum implementation, particularly using Gaussian quadrature grids, remains underexplored. We develop a quantum circuit that efficiently transforms FBR into DVR by following a recursive construction based on quantum arithmetic operations, and we compare this approach with methods that directly load DVR matrix elements using quantum read-only memory (QROM). We analyze the quantum resources, including T-gate and qubit counts, required for implementing the DVR unitary and discuss preferable choices of QROM-based and recursive-based methods for a given matrix size and precision.

A coherence based measure is employed to quantify non-Markovianity, and a unified quantum speed limit bound is derived based on relative purity. Our results reveal that in thermodynamic equilibrium, non-Markovian memory effects significantly reduce the quantum speed limit time, accelerating quantum evolution through information backflow. In contrast, under non-equilibrium initial conditions, the system exhibits purely Markovian behavior regardless of coupling strength, although strong coupling still leads to speedup via enhanced dephasing.

This is partially due to the variety of fault-tolerant logical protocols that can be implemented in two dimensions using local operations. One such protocol is the lattice surgery-based logical state teleportation, which transfers a logical quantum state from an initial location on a quantum chip to a target location through a linking region of qubits. This protocol serves as a basis for higher-level routines, such as the entangling CNOT gate or magic state injection. In this work we investigate the correctability phase diagram of this protocol for distinct error rates inside the surface code patches and within the linking region. We adopt techniques from statistical physics to describe the numerically observed crossover regime between correctable and uncorrectable quantum error correction phases, where the correctability depends on the separation between the initial and target locations. We find that inside the crossover regime the correctability-threshold lines decay as a power law with increasing separation, which we explain accurately using a finite-size scaling analysis. Our results indicate that the logical state teleportation protocol can tolerate much higher noise rates in the linking region compared to the bulk of the surface code patches, provided the separation between the positions is relatively small.",

To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens enables stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion.

    "summary": "Quantum hardware is advancing rapidly across various platforms, yet implementing large-scale quantum error correction (QEC) remains challenging. As hardware continues to improve, there is a growing need to identify potential applications on noisy quantum devices that can leverage these enhancements. With this motivation, we explore the advantages of shallow measurements over (non-entangling) single-qubit measurements for learning various properties of a quantum state. While previous studies have examined this subject, they have primarily focused on specific problems. Here, by developing a new theoretical framework, we demonstrate how shallow measurements can benefit in diverse scenarios. Despite the additional errors from two-qubit gates in shallow measurements, we experimentally validated improvements compared to single-qubit measurements in applications like derandomization, common randomized measurements, and machine learning up to 40 qubits and 46 layers of two-qubit gates, respectively. As a result, we show that hardware improvements, even before QEC, could broaden the range of feasible applications.",

    "summary": "Topological invariants are crucial for characterizing topological systems. However, experimentally measuring them presents a significant challenge, especially in non-Hermitian systems where the biorthogonal eigenvectors are often necessary. We propose a general approach for measuring the topological invariants of one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, which can be derived from the spin textures of right eigenstates. By utilizing a dilation method, we realize a non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry on a two-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system and measure the winding number associated with the eigenstates. In addition to examining the topology of the eigenstates, our experiment also reveals the topological structure of the energy band, which differs from that in chiral systems. Our work paves the way for further exploration of complex topological properties in non-Hermitian systems without chiral symmetry.",

Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.",

While the original protocol requires Alice to prepare six quantum states in $Z$, $X$, and $Y$ bases, its reliance on active modulation introduces inherent side-channel vulnerabilities from device imperfections. We address this security limitation by integrating a fully passive source into the RFI framework. In this paper, we propose a fully passive RFI QKD protocol. Our protocol avoids active modulation entirely, suppressing side-channel risks through passive quantum state generation. Moreover, by making full utilization of the quantum states generated by the fully passive source, we enhance the secure key rate of fully passive protocol. We establish a system model to analyze the performance of the protocol. Through the optimization of post-selection intervals and intensities, we obtain the maximum secure key transmission rate of the protocol. Under ideal circumstances, the secure key transmission rate of our protocol can reach more than 50% of that of the ideal QKD. Under practical conditions, we have considered the finite-length effect. When pulse number generated by the source reaches $10^{12}$, the maximum communication distances of the protocol can reach 167 km and 136 km with a reference frame misalignment of $0 $ and $45^{\\circ} $ respectively.

Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians.

However, executing quantum operations remains challenging for small-scale users because of several hardware constraints, making it desirable to delegate parts of the computation to more powerful quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms (DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the execution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we introduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum algorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the computation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort, the client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This work builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and Kashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable Protocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization step of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient optimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We also simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field Ising Model. Our results demonstrate that secure delegation of variational quantum algorithms is a realistic solution for near-term quantum networks, paving the way for practical quantum cloud computing applications.",

These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of \"36 officers\". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. (In particular, Leonhard would have had no means of dealing with such solutions to his own puzzle -- an unsatisfactory state of affairs). In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\\mathbb{C}^6)^{\\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\\mathbb{C}^3)^{\\otimes 2}\\oplus(\\mathbb{C}^3)^{\\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and \\.Zyczkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families. Finally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of quasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.",

While this is straightforward for convex objective functions, higher-order formulations pose challenges due to their inherent non-convexity. In this work, we propose branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BB-DCQO), a quantum algorithm that addresses the relaxation difficulties in higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. By employing bias fields as approximate solutions to the relaxed problem, we iteratively enhance the quality of the results compared to the bare bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm. We refer to this enhanced method as BBB-DCQO. In order to benchmark it against simulated annealing (SA), we apply it on sparse HUBO instances with up to $156$ qubits using tensor network simulations. To explore regimes that are less tractable for classical simulations, we experimentally apply BBB-DCQO to denser problems using up to 100 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We compare our results with SA and a greedy-tuned quantum annealing baseline. In both simulations and experiments, BBB-DCQO consistently achieved higher-quality solutions with significantly reduced computational overhead, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating counterdiabatic quantum methods into branch-and-bound to address hard non-convex optimization tasks.",

In the case of a pure $SU(N)$ gauge theory, two gluons in a product state can be entangled in their polarizations as the result of three- and four-gluon vertex interactions. We find that entanglement is only produced when the initial product state have opposite polarizations, and that maximal entanglement is generated when the outgoing particles form an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ with respect to the incoming ones. A surprising result is that the amount of entanglement among gluon polarizations is independent of the gauge group at any angle and, thus, of the color degree of freedom. Universality of entanglement for any gauge group emerges. It is also found that a small deviation of the relative weight between three- and four-gluon vertices would prevent the generation of maximal entanglement. This can be seen as a small piece of a possible it from qubit principle underlying fundamental interactions, that is a principle that requires physics to be quantum in origin.",

We also discuss evidence for these hardness assumptions by analyzing the best-known quantum learning algorithms, as well as proving black-box lower bounds for cloning and learning given state preparation oracles.   Our random circuit-based constructions provide concrete instantiations of quantum cryptographic primitives whose security do not depend on the existence of one-way functions. The use of random circuits in our constructions also opens the door to NISQ-friendly quantum cryptography. We discuss noise tolerant versions of our OWSG and digital signature constructions which can potentially be implementable on noisy quantum computers connected by a quantum network. On the other hand, they are still secure against noiseless quantum adversaries, raising the intriguing possibility of a useful implementation of an end-to-end cryptographic protocol on near-term quantum computers.

We use the GCR scheme to design parametric two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, that act on the $0{-}1$ and $1{-}2$ energy transitions of transmons. Our gates improve upon the existing works in two aspects. First, our gates directly allow for entanglement on the $1{-}2$ levels rather than merely relying on $0{-}1$ entanglement, as in previous works. Second, our gates are parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest, whereas the purview of prior works that use cross-resonance for qutrits was limited to individual gates. Using numerical simulation in Qiskit Dynamics, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates, which are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate fidelities of $99.73\\pm 0.01\\%, 97.88\\pm 0.01\\%, 99.39\\pm 0.01\\%$, and $98.99\\pm 0.01\\%$, respectively.

In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several \"fine-grained\" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferromagnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states and recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter.

However, quantum information lifetime enhancement can be achieved by dynamical decoupling techniques (DD), where an external drive with a frequency much higher than the system's internal evolution renders signal acquisition with decay times greater than 1000-fold. In this study, we demonstrate that the system response during a prethermal period, subject to Floquet control, can be utilized to probe the multiple quantum evolution of dense and highly connected spin systems. This approach exhibits an enhanced sensitivity at a reduced experimental time. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved enabled the use of numerical inversion strategies to model the evolution of the excited multiple quantum coherences, which describe the number of correlated spins within a cluster.

In this work, we perform a preliminary analysis of the quantum circuit compilation process in Qiskit, examining the cumulative runtime of each individual compilation task and identifying the tasks that most strongly impact the overall compilation time. Our results indicate that, as the desired level of optimization increases, circuit optimization and gate synthesis passes become the dominant tasks in compiling a Quantum Fourier Transform, with individual passes consuming up to 87% of the total compilation time.

Specifically, we analyze the quantum dynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position--momentum correlations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal intriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the wavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving rise to Gouy phase contributions of $\\pi/4$ rad, establishing a clear link between the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the interplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a total Gouy phase accumulation of $\\pi/2$ rad in an oscillation period. Both squeezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering and quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship between these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision measurement.",

Here, we propose two wireless transfer schemes with parity-time symmetries to efficiently extract the energy stored in non-Hermitian QBs to consumption centers. For linear cases, the transfer energy oscillates periodically in the unbroken symmetry region and grows hyperbolically in the broken region. For nonlinear cases, the transfer energy eventually reach and remain steady-state values arising from the feedback mechanism of the nonlinear saturable gain. Furthermore, we show the significant robustness and the ultrafast response of the wireless transfer schemes to sudden movements around one metre.

The system is defined by a free-evolution Lindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally occurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The performance metric for optimization is the fidelity between the projector onto the code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a specified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words, induced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply the method to optimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system with uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating the operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the optimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more complicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the algorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the well-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to search for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case, the algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code and any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial guess.",

We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader.

Moreover, the minimal assumption for computational quantum cryptography remains an open question. Recently, it has been shown that pseudoentanglement is necessary for the existence of quantum cryptography (Goul\\~ao and Elkouss 2024), but no cryptographic construction has been built from it.   In this work, we study the cryptographic usefulness of quantum pseudoresources -- a pair of families of quantum states that exhibit a gap in their resource content yet remain computationally indistinguishable. We show that quantum pseudoresources imply a variant of EFI pairs, which we call EPFI pairs, and that these are equivalent to quantum commitments and thus EFI pairs. Our results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical cryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the quantum setting.   Finally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different definitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI pairs.

    "summary": "Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification. While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.",

In contrast to conventional Floquet topological phases, our result provides a way to realize exotic topological phases without changing symmetries.

BHSI models measurement as the unitary branching of a system's local Hilbert space into decoherent subspaces, formalized through causal state updates using branching and disengaging operators. Unlike MWI, BHSI avoids parallel worlds by maintaining a single-world ontology in which branching is confined to observable subspaces; unlike Copenhagen, it eliminates collapse while recovering the Born rule through branch weights. Through physically meaningful subspace records, the framework resolves quantum paradoxes such as particle-wave duality, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, etc. It remains consistent with interference patterns, entanglement correlations, and information preservation. By comparing BHSI with QBism, Relational Quantum Mechanics, and modal interpretations, as well as analyzing quantum teleportation (where locally decoherent Hilbert subspaces are observed), we demonstrate its advantages as a causally sound and empirically grounded approach that reconciles unitary evolution with definite measurement outcomes without metaphysical proliferation.",

In addition, electric dipole and magnetic moments are computed with the self-consistent field method. Analysis of the results from both methods shows that the dominant molecular configuration of the ground state is one where an electron from the partially filled and submerged 4f orbital of the lanthanide atom moves to the hydroxyl group, leaving the closed outer-most 6s$^2$ lone electron pair of the lanthanide atom intact in sharp contrast to the bonding in alkaline-earth monohydroxides and YbOH, where an electron from the outer-most s shell moves to the hydroxyl group.

We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively.

Syndrome extraction data provides information about the processes that cause errors. The collective effects of these processes can be described by a detector error model (DEM). We show how to estimate probabilities of individual DEM events, and of aggregated classes of DEM events, using data from multiple cycles of syndrome extraction.",

    "summary": "Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.",

Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling.

    "summary": "The main approach to hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (QNN) is employing quantum computing to build a neural network (NN) that has quantum features, which is then optimized classically. Here, we propose a different strategy: to use quantum computing in order to optimize the weights of a classical NN. As such, we design an instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters of an NN during the training process, a task traditionally performed using the backpropagation algorithm with the gradient descent method. Indeed, gradient descent has issues such as exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, or convexity problem. Other methods tried to address such issues with strategies like genetic searches, but they carry additional problems like convergence consistency. Our original method avoids these issues -- because it does not calculate gradients -- and capitalizes on classical architectures' robustness and Grover's quadratic speedup in high-dimensional search spaces to significantly reduce test loss (58.75%) and improve test accuracy (35.25%), compared to classical NN weight optimization, on small datasets. Unlike most QNNs that are trained on small datasets only, our method is also scalable, as it allows the optimization of deep networks; for an NN with 3 hidden layers, trained on the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, we obtained a mean accuracy of 97.7%. Moreover, our method requires a much smaller number of qubits compared to other QNN approaches, making it very practical for near-future quantum computers that will still deliver a limited number of logical qubits.",

However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs.",

Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or \"snapshots,\" of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing. This capability is essential for debugging, introspection, and persistent memory in quantum systems, yet remains difficult due to the no-cloning theorem and destructive measurements. Our guess-and-check approach uses fidelity estimation via the SWAP test to guide state reconstruction. We explore both gradient-based deep neural networks and gradient-free evolutionary strategies to estimate quantum states using only fidelity as the learning signal. We demonstrate a key component of our framework on IBM quantum hardware, achieving high-fidelity (approximately 1.0) reconstructions for Hadamard and other known states.

Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases.

We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.",

In this study, we have categorized the light-matter coupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate, $\\lambda/\\omega_c\\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \\leq \\lambda/\\omega_c\\leq 0.5$, ultra-strong, $0.5 \\leq\\lambda/\\omega_c\\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong, $\\lambda/\\omega_c\\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\\lambda$ is the coupling strength and $\\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency.

It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state when the coupled system is in the ground state.

For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations.

    "summary": "Ptychography is a computational imaging technique mainly used in optical and electron microscopy. Its quantum analogue was recently introduced as a simple method for estimating unknown pure quantum states through projections onto partially overlapping subspaces, each one followed by a projective measurement in the Fourier basis. In the end, an iterative algorithm estimates the state from the collected data. Here, we theoretically describe how to implement this method for $D$-dimensional qudit states encoded in the angular position and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of single photons. For this purpose, we define the qudit by discretizing the spatial profile of a photon in cylindrical coordinates, using an array of $D$ angular slits symmetrically distributed in the transverse plane. To apply ptychography to this encoding, we show that the intermediate projections will be carried out by simple binary spatial filters in the angular paths, while the measurement in the Fourier basis will be performed by postselecting $D$ OAM modes compatible with the quantum Fourier transform of the path basis. We illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme through simulations and discuss its experimental feasibility.",

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.",

Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC.

Carrying out state preparation on real quantum hardware for up to 19 qubits, we demonstrate its suitability for current quantum devices. In addition, we study the real-time dynamics of a flux tube between two static charges using both Tensor Networks and quantum hardware.

These eventually redistribute towards the static charges and screen them, which leads to the breaking of the flux tube.",

These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption.",

Using superconducting circuits, two-qubit gates have previously been implemented in different ways with each method aiming to maximize gate fidelity. Another important goal of a new gate scheme is to minimize the complexity of gate calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a high-fidelity two-qubit gate between two fluxonium qubits enabled by an intermediate capacitively coupled transmon. The coupling strengths between the qubits and the coupler are designed to minimize residual crosstalk while still allowing for fast gate operations. The gate is based on frequency selectively exciting the coupler using a microwave drive to complete a 2$\\pi$ rotation, conditional on the state of the fluxonium qubits. When successful, this drive scheme implements a conditional phase gate. Using analytically derived pulse shapes, we minimize unwanted excitations of the coupler and obtain gate errors of $10^{-2}$ for gate times below 60~ns. At longer durations, our gate is limited by relaxation of the coupler. Our results show how carefully designed control pulses can speed up frequency selective entangling gates.",

Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces.

In this work, we report on the emergence of the rf pseudo-null, a locus of points where the ion responds to light as if it were at the true rf null, despite being displaced from it. The phenomenon is fully explained by accounting for the general two-dimensional structure of micromotion and is experimentally verified under various potential configurations, with observations in great agreement with numerical simulations. The rf pseudo-null manifests as a line in a two-dimensional parameter space, determined by the geometry of the incident light and its overlap with the motional structure of the ion.

These fractions are then adapted to reproduce LBM equilibrium distributions, resulting in an adaptive lattice gas algorithm (ALGA) that achieves the same simulation results of LBM. Considering this, we develop a quantum algorithm that involves a linear collision operator and capable of simulating the same phenomena, while still using a measurement and reinitialization procedure.",

The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for \"heralded loss,\" when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection.

However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.",

A comparison between experimental results and electromagnetic (EM) calculations revealed that a large EM enhancement factor (FR) at the HS appears in the visible to NIR regions owing to EM coupling between localized plasmons of the NP and surface plasmons of the NW. This ultrabroad resonance of the coupled plasmons enables the observation of two-photon-excited emissions with CW laser excitation. A comparison of the dependence of the NP diameter, NW diameter, and gap distance on two-photon-excited emissions further demonstrated that the large HS-by-HS variations in the emission intensities were mainly induced by the sensitivity of FR to the gap distance at the HSs.

Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs.

    "summary": "The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.",

    "summary": "The GKP encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit using damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB) decoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The second twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other sources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding.",

Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.",

Errors are corrected by measuring a sequence of Pauli operators that we refer to as the verification sequence. We first propose a global optimization algorithm searching for a verification sequence resulting in a low logical error rate using tabu search. Then, we introduce a proxy for the logical error rate which is easier to evaluate and we design a two-step optimization algorithm. First, a verification sequence minimizing the proxy is computed, then this sequence is refined by reintroducing the logical error rate. Finally, we identify a large group of automorphisms of the search space which preserve the proxy and we use this symmetry to reduce the size of the search space. This results in a 168 $\\times$ (respectively 20,160 $\\times$) reduction of the size of the search space for the optimization of verification sequences with three (respectively four) Pauli operators. Our numerical simulations for 20-qubit Clifford circuits with size 400 under the ion chain model show that our optimization algorithms improve the performance of CliNR by 25% and that the two-step optimization achieves the same results as the global optimization with 64% fewer evaluations of the logical error rate.

These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.

However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations.

    "summary": "An optical lattice is a periodic light crystal constructed from the standing-wave interference patterns of laser beams. It can be used to store and manipulate quantum degenerate atoms and is an ideal platform for the quantum simulation of many-body physics. A principal feature is that optical lattices are flexible and possess a variety of multidimensional geometries with modifiable band-structure. An even richer landscape emerges when control functions can be applied to the lattice by modulating the position or amplitude with Floquet driving. However, the desire for realizing high-modulation bandwidths while preserving extreme lattice stability has been difficult to achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective solution that consists of overlapping two counterpropagating lattice beams and controlling the phase and intensity of each with independent acousto-optic modulators. Our phase controller mixes sampled light from both lattice beams with a common optical reference. This dual heterodyne locking method allows exquisite determination of the lattice position, while also removing parasitic phase noise accrued as the beams travel along separate paths. We report up to 50dB suppression in lattice phase noise in the 0.1Hz - 1Hz band along with significant suppression spanning more than four decades of frequency. When integrated, the absolute phase diffusion of the lattice position is only 10\\r{A} over 10 s. This method permits precise, high-bandwidth modulation (above 50kHz) of the optical lattice intensity and phase.

After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\\rightarrow\\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings.

We emphasize that the error scales as $ \\epsilon = O(\\kappa T / R^c) $ with $c \\geq 1$, indicating that the required $R$ decreases significantly with increasing $c$ to achieve a desired error. Furthermore, we discuss that if the sufficient condition is not satisfied, logical errors may be induced that cannot be efficiently corrected by the canonical AutoQEC framework.

Transmission electron microscopes are well-established tools for materials characterisation with unparalleled spatial resolution. They provide control over the preparation and detection of high energy electrons, with largely unexploited potential in the study of many-body quantum correlations. Here, we demonstrate entanglement in electron-photon pairs generated via cathodoluminescence in a transmission electron microscope. Employing coincidence imaging techniques adapted from photonic quantum optics, we reconstruct both near- and far-field ``ghost'' images of periodic transmission masks. By measuring spatial and momentum correlations, we show a violation of the classical uncertainty bound: $\\Delta x_-^2 \\Delta k_+^2 = 0.502 \\pm 0.047<1$. Hence, we demonstrate entanglement in position and momentum -- the continuous variables at the base of most imaging methods, bridging the fields of electron microscopy and quantum optics.

The proposed optomagnomechanical configuration utilizes the coupling between magnetostriction-induced mechanical displacements and the optical cavity via radiation pressure. Magnons - collective spin excitations in macroscopic ferromagnets - are directly driven by an electromagnetic field. We demonstrate the generation of macroscopic magnon entanglement by exciting the optical cavity with a red detuned microwave field and the YIG crystals with a blue detuned field. Our analysis reveals that magnon entanglement vanishes for identical magnomechanical couplings but remains robust against thermal fluctuations. The magnon modes entangled in two ferrimagnetic crystals represent genuine macroscopic quantum states with potential applications in the study of macroscopic quantum mechanics and quantum information processing based on magnonics. The configuration is based on experimentally accessible parameters, providing a feasible route of quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) faces significant challenges due to hardware noise and the presence of barren plateaus and local traps in the optimization landscape. To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we introduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and accuracy by projecting VQE optimizations on to a reduced-dimensional subspace, followed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz into a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary subspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the parameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this hierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace only. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space reconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These reconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the cost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC) leading to a \"plummeting effect\" in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minima without utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical simulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our method can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the minima. Additionally, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a novel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for accelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms. Our method shows heuristic evidences of alleviating the effects of local traps, facilitating convergence toward a more optimal minimum.",

Drawing on historical parallels in classical computing, we explain why having the \"right\" quantum abstract machine (QAM) is essential for making progress in the field and propose a novel framework for evaluating QAMs based on a set of desirable criteria. These criteria capture aspects of a QAM such as universality, compactness, expressiveness, and composability, which aid in the representation of quantum programs. By defining this framework we take steps toward defining an optimal QAM. We further apply our framework to survey the landscape of existing proposals, draw comparisons, and assess them based on our criteria. While these proposals share many common strengths, we find that each falls short of our ideal.

Entanglement has been realised in a variety of physical systems, spanning atoms, ions, photons, collective excitations, and hybrid combinations of particles. Remarkably, however, photons and free electrons -- the quanta of light and their most elementary sources -- have never been observed in an entangled state. Here, we demonstrate quantum entanglement between free electrons and photons. We show that entanglement is produced when an electron, prepared in a superposition of two beams, passes a nanostructure and generates transition radiation in a polarisation state tied to the electron path. By implementing quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the full density matrix of the electron-photon pair, and show that the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is violated by more than 7 standard deviations. Based on this foundational element of emerging free-electron quantum optics, we anticipate manifold developments in enhanced electron imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit.

Machine learning models have shown great promise as decoders for the surface code; however, this promise has not yet been substantiated for the more challenging task of decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. In this paper, we present a recurrent, transformer-based neural network designed to decode circuit-level noise on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes, introduced recently by Bravyi et al (Nature 627, 778-782, 2024). For the $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code, at a physical error rate of $p=0.1\\%$, our model achieves a logical error rate almost $5$ times lower than belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD). Moreover, while BP-OSD has a wide distribution of runtimes with significant outliers, our model has a consistent runtime and is an order-of-magnitude faster than the worst-case times from a benchmark BP-OSD implementation. On the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, our model obtains worse logical error rates but maintains the speed advantage. These results demonstrate that machine learning decoders can out-perform conventional decoders on QLDPC codes, in regimes of current interest.",

When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection.

We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, like, e.g., the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach.",

We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure fermionic and bosonic single-particle spectra of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Schwinger model, respectively, and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the experiment, we further introduce a signal-processing strategy that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.",

    "summary": "Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.",

However, in port-based teleportation (PBT), this local processing can begin before the classical message is received, thereby allowing for asynchronous quantum information processing. Motivated by resource-theoretic considerations and practical applications, we propose different communication models that progressively allow for more powerful decoding strategies while still permitting asynchronous distributed quantum computation, a salient feature of standard PBT. Specifically, we consider PBT protocols augmented by free classical processing and/or different forms of quantum pre-processing, and we investigate the maximum achievable teleportation fidelities under such operations. Our analysis focuses specifically on the PBT power of isotropic states, bipartite graph states, and symmetrized EPR states, and we compute tight bounds on the optimal teleportation fidelities for such states. We finally show that, among this hierarchy of communication models consistent with asynchronous quantum information processing, the strongest resource theory is equally as powerful as any one-way teleportation protocol for surpassing the classical teleportation threshold. Thus, a bipartite state can break the one-way classical teleportation threshold if and only if it can be done using the trivial decoding map of discarding subsystems.",

However, current VQAs such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower performance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and suffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We propose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard VQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while avoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone VQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut problem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of the 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation procedure. Finally, these performance guarantees are verified by numerical simulations and hardware demonstrations on IBM quantum devices. In a 72-qubit demonstration, the single-round light-cone VQA achieves the exact MaxCut solution whereas the $p$-round QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ only obtains approximate solutions. Furthermore, the single-round light-cone VQA derives solutions surpassing the hardness threshold in a 148-qubit demonstration while QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ does not.

More specifically, we show that there exist UCJ circuits for which classical simulation of sampling cannot be performed in polynomial time, under a reasonable complexity-theoretical assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse. Our main contribution is to show that a class of UCJ circuits can be used to perform arbitrary instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) computations, which are already known to be classically hard to simulate under the same complexity assumption. As a side result, we also show that UCJ equipped with post-selection can generate the class post-BQP. Our demonstration, worst-case nonsimulatability of UCJ, would potentially imply quantum advantage in quantum algorithms for chemistry and physics using unitary coupled cluster type ansatzes, such as the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum-selected configuration interaction.",

The error sampler can be efficiently implemented in conjunction with quantum error correction. We provide rigorous analyses of bias and cost, showing that the cost of measuring the parameter and sampling errors is low -- comparable to the cost of the computation itself.

To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems).

D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. Further we observe the vanishing of mutual information and discord. It implies the absence of both classical and non-classical correlations which are not related to entanglement. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.",

In this letter, we present a novel optical method that {\\it eliminates these constraints entirely.} Specifically, we demonstrate that in the presence of a static electric field, there is a selection rule for two-photon electric-dipole transitions that differs between enantiomers. This distinction arises because the static electric field breaks the symmetry associated with the combined action of a specific rotation and time-reversal transformation. Leveraging the enantiospecific two-photon selection rule, one can selectively excite a desired enantiomer using two beams, without the need for phase locking, resonance condition, and the precise control of their intensities and operation times.

We compare this combined approach with standard QAOA and other parameter setting strategies such as INTERP and FOURIER, which require computationally demanding incremental layer-by-layer optimization. Notably, previously known methods like INTERP and FOURIER yield parameters that can be well fitted by linear functions, which supports our linearization strategy.

Our experiments extend from classical simulation to actual quantum hardware implementation on IBM's Eagle processor, demonstrating the approach's viability on current NISQ devices. Furthermore, the numerical results indicate that parameter transferability primarily depends on the energy scale of problem instances, with normalization techniques improving transfer quality. Most of our numerical experiments are conducted on the random Ising model, while problem-dependence is also investigated across other models.

However, statistical fluctuations and physical noise degrade the solution quality, so it is difficult to maintain applicability for large-scale problems. In contrast, Sampling-based Quantum Algorithms have recently been successfully applied to large-scale quantum chemistry problems. The quantum device is used only for sampling, and the ground state and its energy are estimated on the classical device. In this study, we propose the Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm (SQOA). Two challenges exist in constructing a Sampling-based Quantum Algorithm for combinatorial optimization. The first challenge is that we need to encode the optimization problem in a non-diagonal Hamiltonian, even though many VQAs encode it into the Ising Hamiltonian, which is diagonal. The second challenge is that we need a method to prepare the input state to be sampled efficiently. We employ the Quantum Relaxation (QR) method for the first challenge, which encodes multiple classical variables in one qubit. It reduces required qubits compared to the Ising Hamiltonian approach. Moreover, we investigate the parameter transferability in the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for QR Hamiltonians for the second challenge. We show that restricting parameters to a linear form exhibits moderate transferability for 3-regular MaxCut problems, similar to transferability observed in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. This property allows us to efficiently prepare the input state for a large instance using the parameters from a small instance. We leveraged transferability to create input states and applied SQOA with QR to the MaxCut instances.

In this study, we examine how NDAR performance improves by adjusting the balance between these components. We control the degree of exploitation by varying the delay time to 0, 50, and $100~\\mu\\text{s}$, and investigate exploration strategies using two quantum circuits, QAOA and a random circuit, on IBM's Heron processor. Our results show that increasing delay time in NDAR improves the best objective value found in each iteration. In single-layer QAOA and random circuits applied to unweighted Max-Cut problem with low edge density, both exploration strategies yield similar objective value trajectories and provide competitive solution quality to simulated annealing for the 80-node problem. Their similar performance indicates that, in most cases, increasing amplitude damping noise via additional delay time results in information loss. On the other hand, QAOA outperforms random circuits in specific cases, such as positive-negative weighted Max-Cut on a fully connected graph. This suggests potential advantages of QAOA in more complex settings. We further develop a classical NDAR to better understand exploration strategies, demonstrating that controlling the Hamming weight distribution of sampled bitstrings yields higher quality solutions.

To address these issues, we explore a slack-free formulation that directly encodes inequality constraints using custom penalty functions, specifically the exponential function and the Heaviside step function. These step-like penalties suppress infeasible solutions without introducing additional qubits or requiring finely tuned weights. Inspired by recent developments in quantum annealing and threshold-based constraint handling in gate-based algorithms, we implement and evaluate our approach on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP).

Recently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a ground-state preparation algorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE has demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has been applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. In this work, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained optimization using VarQITE. We show that VarQITE achieves significantly lower mean optimality gaps compared to QAOA and other conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that scaling the Hamiltonian coefficients can further reduce optimization costs and accelerate convergence.",

Our featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression. Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.",

    "summary": "Superdense Coding is a cornerstone in secure quantum communication, exploiting pre-shared entanglement to encode two classical bits within a single qubit. However, noise and decoherence deteriorate entanglement quality, restricting both fidelity and channel capacity in practical settings. Traditional methods, such as error correcting codes or entanglement distillation, are generally inadequate for dynamically varying noise conditions. Moreover, reliance on fidelity alone may fail to capture more subtle noise effects. This work introduces an adaptive protocol that integrates the five-qubit perfect code with a novel global adaptive purification that avoids discarding entangled pairs. By monitoring two information entropy-based metrics, quantum discord (QD) and entanglement of formation (EoF) from pilot pairs, we dynamically tune a global unitary to counteract noise. Our simulations, under both amplitude and phase damping, indicate that this integrated strategy could significantly enhance superdense coding robustness while preserving high throughput, thereby offering a scalable pathway toward a high-capacity quantum internet.",

Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.",

In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter can be described by means of two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each described by its own spectral density. Therefore, for initial thermal states of the reservoirs having different temperatures, the common approach based on the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object cannot be employed. We study the interaction of a quantum emitter with these two reservoirs introducing a temperature-dependent effective spectral density of the electromagnetic environment, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.",

The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.",

This work takes a step in that direction by providing an implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm, compiled to elementary quantum gates using PennyLane and Catalyst, a library for quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compilation of hybrid workflows. We demonstrate that with QJIT compilation, the algorithm is compiled once per bit width of $N$, the integer being factored, even when $N$-specific optimizations are applied to circuit generation based on values determined at runtime. The implementation is benchmarked up to 32-bit $N$, and both the size of the compiled program and the pure compilation time are found to be constant (under 3 seconds on a laptop computer), meaning code generation becomes tractable even for realistic problem sizes.",

Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.",

    "summary": "Evaluating the maximum amount of work extractable from a nanoscale quantum system is one of the central problems in quantum thermodynamics. Previous works identified the free energy of the input state as the optimal rate of extractable work under the crucial assumption: experimenters know the description of the given quantum state, which restricts the applicability to significantly limited settings. Here, we show that this optimal extractable work can be achieved without knowing the input states at all, removing the aforementioned fundamental operational restrictions. We achieve this by presenting a universal work extraction protocol, whose description does not depend on input states but nevertheless extracts work quantified by the free energy of the unknown input state. Remarkably, our result partially encompasses the case of infinite-dimensional systems, for which optimal extractable work has not been known even for the standard state-aware setting. Our results clarify that, in spite of the crucial difference between the state-aware and state-agnostic scenarios in accomplishing information-theoretic tasks, whether we are in possession of information on the given state does not influence the optimal performance of the asymptotic work extraction.",

By taking advantage of the dispersion profile of commercially available single-mode fibers, we achieve all-optical switching of photon-number states, with up to 6 photons, with a switching resolution of 2.3ps.

Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.",

Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - \"Schwinger atoms\" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.",

It is the building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first three moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is essential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in pseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation. At the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the Clifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been limited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits $n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our first result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and computes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$. We also introduce an alternative and easy-to-manipulate basis formed by isotropic sums of Pauli operators. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations -which generate the unitary group commutant- and at most three other operators. Additionally, we develop a graphical calculus allowing a diagrammatic manipulation of elements of this basis. These results enable a wealth of applications: among others, we characterize all measurable magic measures and identify optimal strategies for stabilizer property testing, whose success probability also offers an operational interpretation to stabilizer entropies. Finally, we show that these results also generalize to multi-qudit systems with prime local dimension.",

Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.",

In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or half-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin distribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find a half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs.

However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries.

Erasure qubits, which enable hardware-level detection of dominant error types, offer a promising path toward resource-efficient QEC by exploiting error bias. Single erasure qubits with dual-rail encoding in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high coherence and low single-qubit gate errors with mid-circuit erasure detection, but the generation of multi-qubit entanglement--a fundamental requirement for quantum computation and error correction--has remained an outstanding milestone. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting processor integrating four dual-rail erasure qubits that achieves the logical multi-qubit entanglement with error-biased protection. Each dual-rail qubit, encoded in pairs of tunable transmons, preserves millisecond-scale coherence times and single-qubit gate errors at the level of $10^{-5}$. By engineering tunable couplings between logical qubits, we generate high-fidelity entangled states resilient to physical qubit noise, including logical Bell states (98.8% fidelity) and a three-logical-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (93.5% fidelity).

Nonetheless, probability conservation is not lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different form.

In consequence, the time delay associated with decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation. Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all.

In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\\alpha\\in(0,\\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\\alpha\\to 0$.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.",

    "summary": "Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become localized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a well-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to diagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.",

    "summary": "A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.",

    "summary": "Non-orientable manifolds, such as the M\\\"obius strip and the Klein bottle, defy conventional geometric intuition through their twisted boundary conditions. As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give rise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of exceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct topological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we demonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends sensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid representations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a feature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric quantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to the absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced, such quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the global manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a Klein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that preserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement these ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic momenta.",

Advancing towards fault-tolerant quantum computing will require an understanding of the underlying error mechanisms in logical primitives as they relate to the performance of quantum error correction. In this work we demonstrate the novel capability to characterize the physical error properties relevant to fault-tolerant operations via cycle error reconstruction. We illustrate this diagnostic capability for a transversal CNOT, a prototypical component of quantum logical operations, in a 16-qubit register of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our error characterization technique offers three key capabilities: (i) identifying context-dependent physical layer errors, enabling their mitigation; (ii) contextualizing component gates in the environment of logical operators, validating the performance differences in terms of characterized component-level physics, and (iii) providing a scalable method for predicting quantum error correction performance using pertinent error terms, differentiating correctable versus uncorrectable physical layer errors.

Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative noise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that thermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric stochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel Hermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical viscous friction. This operator not only preserves the mathematical rigor of open quantum system dynamics but also allows for a well-defined expression of heat exchange between a system and its environment, enabling the formulation of an alternative quantum equipartition theorem. Our framework ensures a precise energy balance that aligns with the first law of thermodynamics and an entropy balance consistent with the second law. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well, for whom it provides new insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the quantum scale. Our results advance the understanding of dissipation in quantum systems and establish a foundation for future studies on stochastic thermodynamics in the quantum domain.",

It is shown that the magnitude of the nonequilibrium Casimir pressure on a warmer plate than the environment is larger and on a cooler plate is smaller than the magnitude of the standard Casimir pressure in the state of thermal equilibrium.

    "summary": "Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.",

DECONET organizes compute resources in a network-integrated hybrid tree-grid structure, which results in minimal latency increase and no throughput degradation as the system grows. Specifically, DECONET can be scaled to any arbitrary number of $l$ logical qubits by increasing the compute resources by $O(l \\times log(l))$, which provides the required $O(l)$ growth in I/O resources while incurring only an $O(log(l))$ increase in latency-a modest growth that is sufficient for thousands of logical qubits.

First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems.",

    "title": "Adaptive Error Correction for Entanglement Distillation",
    "summary": "Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on quantum error correction-based entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive error correction scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operation point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes: [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]]. We compare the performance of four different protocols that combine the codes in different ways, where we define a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. While we highlight our innovation under minimal assumptions on noise, the method can be easily generalized to realistic network settings. By combining our approach with good entanglement generation methods and smart routing protocols, we can achieve application requirements in a systematic, resource-efficient, way.",

We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.",

    "summary": "Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap.

    "summary": "Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.",

    "summary": "Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks.",

    "summary": "Quantum phase estimation (QPE) plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms, offering provable speedups in applications such as Shor's factoring algorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for combinatorial and Hamiltonian optimization often integrate QPE with variational protocols-like the quantum approximate optimization Ansatz or variational quantum eigensolver-these approaches typically rely on heuristic techniques requiring parameter optimization. In this work, we present the QPE-based quantum imaginary time evolution (QPE-QITE) algorithm, designed for post-variational ground state estimation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Unlike variational methods, QPE-QITE employs additional ancillae to project the quantum register into low-energy eigenstates, eliminating the need for parameter optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of QPE-QITE by applying it to the low-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is a higher order optimization problem that has been studied in the context of quantum scaling advantage. Scaling estimates for magic state requirements are provided to assess the feasibility of addressing these problems on near-term fault-tolerant devices, establishing a benchmark for quantum advantage. Moreover, we discuss potential implementations of QPE-QITE on existing quantum hardware as a precursor to fault tolerance.",

For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.",

These two cavities are connected via photon tunneling, with the principal cavity being driven by two electromagnetic fields. The photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings are responsible for the magnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT observed in the probe output spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of tunneling coupling, atom-photon coupling, and the magnetic field on the absorption, dispersion, and transmission spectra. We provide an explanation of the mechanism behind the Fano resonance phenomenon. Additionally, we address the phenomenon of slow and light propagation. Moreover, we demonstrate that group delay of the probe field can be improved by increasing photon tunneling strength. We also show that the slow light profile is decreased by adjusting the atom-photon coupling strength. This model is experimentally feasible. We hope these findings have the potential to be applied to the processing of quantum information and communication.",

In multiqudit systems, we determine the maximum achievable dimension of a symmetric GES and demonstrate its realization through this construction.

This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of logical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer code, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation within a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural correspondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This connection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter structure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even in the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to fault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate the key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the framework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes.

Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic proper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a testable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated Sagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between clockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay exceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to decrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced decoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from the Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation speed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets with a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip design that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and includes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This approach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters, with rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control decoherence.

However, one could ask a similar question about unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a small number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find significance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm exists to learn them.   We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to a $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates and returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\\varepsilon$ in time $\\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open question of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact, our algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity known as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn $n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time $\\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several unitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.   In addition, we give a $\\textrm{poly}(n,1/\\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to distinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$ or $\\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised that one is the case. Along the way, we prove structural results about near-Gaussian fermionic unitaries that are likely to be of independent interest.",

Here, we study how the coupling of a quantum system to a non-Markovian environment, i.e., an environment with a frequency-dependent spectral density inducing memory effects, can be used to generate and reshape phase transitions and squeezing in matter phases. Focusing on a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dissipation can be leveraged to engineer tricriticality via the fusion of $2^{\\mathrm{nd}}$-order and $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$-order critical points. We identify phases that arise from different ways of breaking the single weak symmetry of our model, which led us to introduce the concept of \\textit{directional spontaneous symmetry breaking} (DSSB) as a general framework to understand this phenomenon. We show that signatures of DSSB can be seen in the emergence of spin squeezing along different directions, and that the latter is controllable via non-Markovian effects, opening up possibilities for applications in quantum metrology. Finally, we propose an experimental implementation of our non-Markovian model in cavity QED.

Because of this, our new result shows that far more optimistic key-rates are possible for a low number of signals, even in general channels. Furthermore, our proof methods may be broadly applicable to other protocols relying on multiple measurement bases and we prove several technical lemmas that may have independent interest.

    "summary": "Random quantum circuits have been extensively explored for quantum supremacy demonstrations. However, verifying their output distributions remains challenging. Here, we propose the infinite-temperature correlation function (ITCF) as a physically meaningful observable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices one that can be extracted using engineered circuits rather than relying on fully random constructions. This is realized by leveraging peaked quantum states whose probability distributions are sharply peaked at specific outcomes due to constructive interference thus offering more efficient verifiability and stronger signal observability. Rather than using Haar-random states, which often yield vanishing signals through destructive interference, we construct purposefully biased quantum states using either Grover-based amplitude amplification or shallow structured circuits. These engineered states amplify contributions from relevant operator subspaces, enabling robust detection of non-zero ITCF values that would otherwise be suppressed under random-state sampling. Our results highlight a problem-specific state preparation framework that mitigates signal loss from random averaging and facilitates the detection of physically meaningful observables in NISQ devices. We also discuss future extensions to multi-qubit observables, scrambling diagnostics, and variational circuit optimization, underscoring the broader potential of Peaked States for quantum simulation and verification.",

Here we show that the entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) is able to connect intrinsically generic quantum contextuality and nonlocal entanglement. Based on a local scenario, it is proven rigorously that the EUR with optimal measurements can faithfully witness the preparation contextuality addressed in the pioneering work by Spekkens. From a nonlocal viewpoint, we show that the single-party contextuality and two-party entanglement are related by the EUR with quantum memories, which is captured by a trade-off inequality that limits the nonclassicality distribution for a composite quantum system. Moreover, we derive another kind of trade-off inequality between quantum contextuality and Bell nonlocality. It is revealed that both inequalities can be probed experimentally, and two well-designed independent experiments are performed to verify our theoretical predictions in superconducting qubits.",

Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.",

We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness.

Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation.

We present SCOOP, a novel QAOA-based framework for solving constrained optimization problems. SCOOP transforms a constrained problem into an unconstrained counterpart, forming SCOOP problem twins. The QAOA quantum algorithm operates on the unconstrained twin to identify potential optimal and near-optimal solutions. Effective classical post-processing reduces the solution set to the constrained problem space. Our SCOOP approach is solution-enhanced, objective-function-compatible, and scalable. We demonstrate the framework on three NP-hard problems, Minimum Dominating Set, Minimum Maximal Matching, and Minimum Set Cover appearing in practical application domains such as resource allocation, communication networks, and machine learning. We validate SCOOP's feasibility and effectiveness on Xanadu PennyLane simulators.",

    "summary": "We propose a field-theoretic framework that models money-debt dynamics in economic systems through a direct analogy to particle-hole creation in condensed matter physics. In this formulation, issuing credit generates a symmetric pair-money as a particle-like excitation and debt as its hole-like counterpart-embedded within a monetary vacuum field. The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use. This approach provides physicists with a rigorous and intuitive toolset to analyze economic behavior using many-body theory, laying the groundwork for a new class of models in econophysics and interdisciplinary field analysis.",

    "summary": "The ability to localize transmission loss change to a subset of links in optical networks is crucial for maintaining network reliability, performance and security. \\emph{Quantum probes}, implemented by sending blocks of $n$ coherent-state pulses augmented with continuous-variable (CV) squeezing ($n=1$) or weak temporal-mode entanglement ($n>1$) over a lossy channel to a receiver with homodyne detection capabilities, are known to be more sensitive than their quasi-classical counterparts in detecting a sudden increase in channel loss. The enhanced sensitivity can be characterized by the increased Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the homodyne output, before and after the loss change occurs. When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the increase in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency.   In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, generalizing previous results on $n=1$ (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of $n$. Assuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and receiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching capabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have suffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their sensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe construction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss change identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses. We then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule, which allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the lossy links using our constructed probes. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves a quantum advantage in decreasing the detection delay.",

In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.",

Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.",

Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum \"worlds\" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.",

The radiative data, which is encoded into the shear of each null generator, is mapped into an $SU(1,1)$ current algebra on each light ray. We study the resulting quantum theory for both bosonic and fermionic representations. In the fermionic representation, the central charge on each null ray is positive, for bosons it is negative. A negative central charge implies a non-unitary CFT, which has negative norm states. In the model, there is a natural $SU(1,1)$ Casimir. For the bosonic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir can have either sign. For the fermionic representations, the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir is always greater or equal to zero. To exclude negative norm states, we restrict ourselves to the fermionic case. To understand the physical implications of this restriction, we express the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir in terms of the geometric data. In this way, the positivity bound on the $SU(1,1)$ Casimir translates into an upper bound for the shear of each null generator. In the model, this bound must be satisfied for all three-dimensional null hypersurfaces. This in turn suggests to apply it to an entire null foliation in an asymptotically flat spacetime. In this way, we obtain a bound on the radiated power of gravitational waves in the model.",

    "summary": "Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in the pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM approach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape the measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified bit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement results, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each cluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy distribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bit-flip error rates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can mitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise model. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To address the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise channels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees regressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector consisting of machine calibration data (gate & measurement error rates), circuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.) and the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results show that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of 1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set of low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines.

We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\\equiv h(t_i)<0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\\ge 0$. In the $L\\to\\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\\to\\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$.

This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\\Omega = t \\ln t_s/t_s$.

Overall, our algorithm achieves a O(M^2) scaling, compared with the O(M^12) coming from equivalent high-accuracy classical methods. As a concrete application, we show that simulating the spectrum of azidoacetylene (HC2N3), a highly explosive molecule with strong anharmonicities consisting of M = 12 vibrational modes, requires circuits with a maximum 8.47 x 10^8 T gates and 173 logical qubits. By enhancing the training datasets of detection models, the full potential of vibrational spectroscopy for chemical detection could be unlocked across a range of applications, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and medical sensing.",

The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared.

Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.",

How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.",

In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.",

As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \\geq 2$ spatial dimensions.

Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light.

In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\\Phi}_{\\pm}\\rangle\\sim {|{\\alpha_1}\\rangle}\\pm {|{\\alpha_2}\\rangle}$, where ${|{\\alpha_1}\\rangle}$ and ${|{\\alpha_2}\\rangle}$ are spin basis states.

This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.",

We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent homology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac operator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how our approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and distinguishes between trivial and topological phases.

Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode \"Gaussian core state\" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation T that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian core state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the photon-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a core state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and finite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all non-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis. For pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with G_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a Gaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the \"largest\" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar decomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic circuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a new characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann picture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides novel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for understanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.",

Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets.

    "summary": "The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.",

    "summary": "The presence of a dissipative environment disrupts the unitary spectrum of dynamical quantum maps. Nevertheless, key features of the underlying unitary dynamics -- such as their integrable or chaotic nature -- are not immediately erased by dissipation. To investigate this, we model dissipation as a convex combination of a unitary evolution and a random Kraus map, and study how signatures of integrability fade as dissipation strength increases. Our analysis shows that in the weakly dissipative regime, the complex eigenvalue spectrum organizes into well-defined, high-density clusters. We estimate the critical dissipation threshold beyond which these clusters disappear, rendering the dynamics indistinguishable from chaotic evolution. This threshold depends only on the number of spectral clusters and the rank of the random Kraus operator. To characterize this transition, we introduce the eigenvalue angular velocity as a diagnostic of integrability loss. We illustrate our findings through several integrable quantum circuits, including the dissipative quantum Fourier transform. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how noise gradually erases the footprints of integrability in open quantum systems.",

    "summary": "In this work, a novel quantum Fourier ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver is proposed to solve both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE system via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the task of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function $f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which requires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and necessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that encodes $f(x)$. This construction can be highly complex, even for simple functions like $f(x) = x$. An important exception arises for the specific case of $f(x) = sin^2(mx+c)$, which can be encoded more efficiently using a set of $Ry$ rotation gates. To address these challenges, we expand the driving function $f(x)$ as a Fourier series and propose the Quantum Fourier ODE Solver. This approach not only simplifies the construction of the oracle R but also removes the restriction that $f(x)$ must lie within [0,1]. The proposed method was evaluated by solving several representative linear and nonlinear PDEs, including the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The results show that the quantum Fourier ODE solver produces results that closely match both analytical and reference solutions.",

In coupled van der Pol oscillators, synchronization occurs when a system of two or more oscillators interacts. Our investigation demonstrates that introducing the squeezing Hamiltonian in two coupled van der Pol oscillators enhances nonclassical effects, increases quantum correlations, and improves the robustness of synchronization dynamics. This was evidenced through the analysis of the Wigner function and power spectrum, showing significant improvements compared to systems without squeezing.",

In this study, to observe the phenomenon, electron-nucleus spin quantum circuits for different geomagnetic fluxes have been simulated and run through IBM Qiskit quantum processing units with error mitigation techniques. The results of different quantum states are consistent, suggesting singlet-triplet mechanisms that can be emulated, resembling the environment-enabling flights of migratory birds through generations of the avian species.

Our analysis reveals that the leading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with subsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass deviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed to the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to additional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\\'e stresses. We further contrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms, achieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\\%$. Attempts to improve this accuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's wave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the underlying perturbative assumptions.

We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.",

    "summary": "Entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum communication, yet conventional detection relies solely on local measurements. In this work, we present a unified theoretical and experimental framework demonstrating that one-way local operations and classical communication (1-LOCC) can significantly outperform purely local measurements in detecting high-dimensional quantum entanglement. By casting the entanglement detection problem as a semidefinite program (SDP), we derive protocols that minimize false negatives at fixed false-positive rates. A variational generative machine-learning algorithm efficiently searches over high-dimensional parameter spaces, identifying states and measurement strategies that exhibit a clear 1-LOCC advantage. Experimentally, we realize a genuine event-ready protocol on a three-dimensional photonic entanglement source, employing fiber delays as short-lived quantum memories. We implement rapid, FPGA-based sampling of the optimized probabilistic instructions, allowing Bob's measurement settings to adapt to Alice's outcomes in real time. Our results validate the predicted 1-LOCC advantage in a realistic noisy setting and reduce the experimental trials needed to certify entanglement. These findings mark a step toward scalable, adaptive entanglement detection methods crucial for quantum networks and computing, paving the way for more efficient generation and verification of high-dimensional entangled states.",

    "summary": "We theoretically investigate the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in the two-photon Dicke-Stark model, which incorporates both Rabi and Stark coupling. By introducing a Stark coupling term, we significantly reduce the critical Rabi coupling strength required to achieve the SPT, enabling it to occur even in strong coupling regimes. Using mean-field theory, we derive the conditions for the SPT and show that it exhibits a second-order phase transition. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the transition point can be widely tuned by the Stark coupling strength. The signatures of these Stark-tunable SPT points are manifested through atomic averages. When quantum fluctuations are included, the spin-squeezing distributions also reveal the effects of Stark-tunable SPT points. In addition, we propose an experimentally feasible realization using an ion trap system driven by three lasers. Our scheme enables optical switching between normal and superradiant phases through pump field intensity modulation, where the Stark coupling coefficient serves as the optically tunable parameter. Our results offer a new approach to engineer the SPT, extending superradiance-based quantum technologies beyond the ultrastrong coupling regime.",

Our gates are designed to dynamically suppress both detuning and pulse-amplitude noise, with gate times as short as 88 ns. We compare our gates against those of IBM on two separate IBM devices and across sets of up to 18 qubits. Randomized benchmarking is done utilizing our detuning- and amplitude-robust gates in randomized Clifford circuits containing up to 4000 gates. Our gates achieve error-per-Clifford rates that reach as low as 7$\\times10^{-5}$ ($\\pm10^{-6}$) and which remain nearly constant as the compound noise is increased up to 4% amplitude noise and up to a detuning noise of 342 kHz; this is in contrast to the IBM gates, which exhibit rates that drop to order $10^{-3}$ across this range. This range is consistent with the commonly reported frequency fluctuations and with the upper bound of the statistical uncertainty in gate calibration. In addition, we investigate the performance across larger noise ranges of up to 20% amplitude and 3.5 MHz detuning noise using quantum process tomography. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate how SCQC can be tailored to different practical use cases by trading off amplitude-robustness for ultrafast 60 ns dephasing-only robust pulses. Our work establishes experimental guidelines for implementing SCQC-designed dynamically corrected gates on a broad range of qubit hardware to limit the effect of noise-induced errors and decoherence.",

To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium fluid of plasmons.",

Our findings demonstrate that while torsion has been predominantly associated with spin, it can also influence the quantum behavior of spinless particles by inducing a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation through quantum fluctuations, even in flat space. To facilitate quantization in curved spaces, we introduce a novel stochastic variational method. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited to general coordinate systems, with quantum fluctuations arising from a noise term in the stochastic process that is directly influenced by torsion. By requiring consistency with quantum dynamics, we ultimately derive an upper bound on the magnitude of torsion. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which torsion, as predicted in certain extensions of general relativity, can influence quantum systems, with potential implications for early-universe physics and dark matter or energy models.",

(2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the \"strange metal\" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by L.Li et al. (2010) in the \"strange metal\" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\\Omega=2\\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals.

In our approach, adaptive Tabu search dynamically identifies and fixes backbone variables to construct reduced-dimensional subspaces that preserve the critical optimization landscape. These quantum-tractable subproblems are then solved via QAOA, with the resulting solutions iteratively refining the backbone selection in a closed-loop quantum-classical cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only competes with, and in some cases surpasses, traditional classical algorithms but also performs comparably with recently proposed hybrid classical-quantum algorithms.

We directly see a glimpse of how a generalization of the quantum geometric tensor for unitary operators plays a central role in parameter evolution. We try the method with the simplest ansatz (a power series in a time-independent Hamiltonian), which yields considerable improvements over a Taylor series. These improvements are because, unlike for a Taylor series of $\\exp(-iHt)$, time $t$ is not forced to appear in the same order as $H$, giving more flexibility for the description. We demonstrate that our results can also be employed to improve degenerate perturbation theory in a non-perturbative fashion. We concede that our approach described here is most useful for finite-dimensional Hamiltonians. As a first example of applications to perturbation theory, we present AB bilayer graphene, which we downfolded to a 2x2 model; our energy results considerably improve typical second-order degenerate perturbation theory. We then demonstrate that the approach can also be used to derive a non-perturbatively valid Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Here, the approach for a finite-size lattice yields excellent results. However, the corrections are not ideal for the thermodynamic limit (they depend on the number of sites $N$). Nevertheless, the approach adds almost no additional technical complications over typical perturbative expansions of unitary operators, making it ready for deployment in physics questions. One should expect considerably improved couplings for the degenerate perturbation theory of finite-size systems. More work is needed in the many-body case, and we suggest a possible remedy to issues with the thermodynamic limit.

By analyzing the steady-state density matrix and dissipative dynamics, we demonstrate that dissipation is able to drive the system to states dominated by either extended or localized modes, irrespective of the initial conditions. The control mechanism relies on the phase properties of the dissipative operators, which selectively favor specific eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

    "title": "Survival of the Optimized: An Evolutionary Approach to T-depth Reduction",
    "summary": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for realizing practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) but comes with substantial resource overhead. Quantum circuits must be compiled into the Clifford+T gate set, where the non-transversal nature of the T-gates necessitates costly magic distillation. As circuit complexity grows, so does the T-depth: the sequential T-gate layers, due to the decomposition of arbitrary rotations, further increasing the QEC demands. Optimizing T-depth poses two key challenges: it is NP-hard and existing solutions like greedy or brute-force algorithms are either suboptimal or computationally expensive. We address this by framing the problem as a search task and propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach to discover near-optimal T-gate merge patterns across circuit layers. To improve upon convergence and solution quality, we incorporate a mathematical expansion scheme that facilitates reordering layers to identify better merge opportunities, along with a greedy initialization strategy based on T-gate density. Our method achieves up to 79.23% T-depth reduction and 41.86% T-count reduction in large circuits (90-100 qubits). Compared to state-of-the-art methods like the lookahead-based approach, our framework yields an average improvement of 1.2x across varying circuit sizes and T-gate densities. Our approach is hardware-agnostic making it compatible with diverse QEC architectures such as surface codes and QLDPCs, resulting in a scalable and practical optimization framework for near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing.",

    "summary": "The goal of this chapter is to compare the predictions of the semiclassical Rabi model (SRM), which describes the interaction between a two-level system (qubit) and a classical monochromatic wave, and the quantum Rabi model (QRM), under the assumption that the cavity field is initiated in a coherent state with a large average number of photons, ranging from 5K to 40K. First, we show that for a strong atom-field coupling, when the duration of the $\\pi $-pulse (the time interval required to completely excite or deexcite the qubit in the resonant regime) is below $100\\omega ^{-1}$, the behaviour of the atomic excitation probability deviates significantly from the textbook sinusoidal formula derived for the SRM under the rotating-wave approximation, and we present simple analytical and semi-analytical methods to describe more accurately the dynamics. Then we show that the QRM reproduces the qubit's dynamics predicted by the SRM only for initial times, since in the QRM the qubit excitation probability exhibits a collapse behaviour even in the lossless scenario; we also notice that the qualitative behaviour of such collapses is different from the ones occurring in the dissipative SRM. In the rest of this work we study numerically the backreaction of the qubit on the cavity field and the resulting atom--field entanglement, which are disregarded in the SRM. It is shown that the atom-field entanglement increases over time and a maximally entangled state is attained for large times. Moreover, we illustrate how the Rabi oscillations continuously modify the quantum state of the cavity field, which becomes increasingly different from the original coherent state as the time increases.",

    "summary": "There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.",

    "summary": "Nonstabilizerness, commonly referred to as magic, is a quantum property of states associated with the non-Clifford resources required for their preparation. As a resource, magic complements entanglement, and the interplay between these two concepts has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we establish an exact correspondence between the generation of nonlocal magic and operator entanglement under unitary evolutions. Nonlocal magic refers to nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased via local operations, while operator entanglement generalizes entanglement to operator space, characterizing the complexity of operators across a bipartition. Specifically, we prove that a unitary map generates nonlocal magic if and only if it generates operator entanglement on Pauli strings. Guided by this result, we introduce an average measure of a unitary's Pauli-entangling power, serving as a proxy for nonlocal magic generation. We derive analytical formulas for this measure and examine its properties, including its typical value and upper bounds in terms of the nonstabilizerness properties of the evolution.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing promises to revolutionize problem-solving through quantum mechanics, but current NISQ devices face limitations in qubit count and error rates, hindering the execution of large-scale quantum circuits. To address these challenges and improve scalability, two main circuit cutting strategies have emerged: the gate-cut approach, which distributes circuit segments across multiple QPUs (spatial), and the qubit wire cut approach, which divides circuits for sequential execution (temporal). This paper presents a hypergraph-based circuit cutting methodology suitable for both spatial and temporal scenarios. By modeling quantum circuits as high-level hypergraphs, we apply partitioning heuristics such as Stoer-Wagner, Fiduccia-Mattheyses, and Kernighan-Lin to optimize the partitioning process. Our approach aims to reduce communication overhead in spatial cuts and minimize qubit initialization costs in temporal ones. To assess effectiveness, we propose a new evaluation metric called the coupling ratio, which quantifies the trade-offs between communication and initialization. Comparative analyses show that hypergraph partitioning improves the efficiency of distributed quantum architectures. Notably, the Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic offers superior performance and adaptability for real-time circuit cutting on multi-QPU systems. Overall, this work positions hypergraph partitioning as a foundational technique for scalable quantum computing in distributed environments.",

This approach guides the partitioning to maintain groups of ports associated with classical operations, ensuring that the resulting partitions prioritize qubits involved in the same sections of classical operations inherent to the adaptive approach. We present a new hypergraph partitioning algorithm based as an extension of Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic, to support hypergraphs created from adaptive quantum circuits.

We propose an \\emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance.

In this work, we introduce the postquantum quasiprobability under mild assumptions to provide an outer boundary for KD quasiprobability. Specifically, we present qualitative and quantitative evidence to show that the classical, KD, and postquantum quasiprobabilities form a strict hierarchy, in the sense that joint probability distributions are a strict subset of KD quasiprobability distributions that are a strict subset of postquantum ones. Surprisingly, we are able to derive some nontrivial bounds valid for both classical probability and KD quasiprobability, and even valid for the KD quasiprobability generated by an arbitrary number of measurements. Finally, other interesting bounds are obtained, and their implications are noted. Our work solves the fundamental problems of what and how to bound the KD quasiprobability, and hence provides a deeper understanding of utilizing it in quantum information processing.",

While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.",

    "summary": "Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.",

    "summary": "Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.",

A crucial step in realizing such large-scale quantum networks is the integration of entanglement distribution within existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a real-world scalable quantum networking testbed deployed within Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fibers in Berlin. Using commercially available quantum devices and standard add-drop multiplexing hardware, we distribute polarization-entangled photon pairs over dynamically selectable fiber paths ranging from 10 m to 82 km. Quantum signals, transmitted at 1324 nm (O-band), coexist with conventional bidirectional C-band traffic without dedicated fibers or infrastructure changes. Active stabilization of the polarization enables robust long-term performance, achieving entanglement fidelities between 85-99% and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter S-values between 2.36-2.74 during continuous multiday operation. By achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution under real urban conditions with less than 1% downtime, we confirm the feasibility of hybrid quantum-classical networks under real-world conditions at metropolitan scale.

The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.",

We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening.

As a result, a modular quantum computing architecture, comprising small processors interconnected by quantum links, is emerging as a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the requirements that the network must fulfill to enable distributed quantum computation remain largely unexplored. We consider an architecture tailored for qubits with nearest-neighbor physical connectivity, leveraging the surface code for error correction and enabling fault-tolerant operations through lattice surgery and magic state distillation. We propose measurement teleportation as a tool to extend lattice surgery techniques to qubits located on different computing units interconnected via Bell pairs. Through memory simulations, we build an error model for logical operations and deduce an end-to-end resource estimation of Shor's algorithm over a minimalist distributed architecture. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 1e-3, a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible with 379 computing processors, each made with 89781 qubits, with negligible space and time overhead with respect to a monolithic approach without parallelization, if 70 Bell pairs are available per cycle time between each processor with a fidelity exceeding 98.4 percent.",

    "summary": "Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.",

These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel ``lattice grafting'' optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems.

The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics.

In the field of materials science, when a crystallographic dataset includes inadequate or difficult-to-obtain images, synthetic images can be used for image augmentation to mitigate data scarcity and streamline the preparation of datasets for high-throughput analysis. We integrate quantum computing with GANs into a hybrid quantum-classical GAN to generate complex 5-channel electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images of two distinct microstructure phases of steel. By training a quantum circuit at the input layer of a large classical Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) model, we mitigate mode collapse and achieve higher image quality compared to a baseline classical GAN. We generate images from both ferrite and bainite microstructure phases in an end-to-end workflow. With respect to maximum mean discrepancy score, we find that the hybrid quantum-classical WGAN improves over classical Bernoulli GANs in 70% of samples. As the quantum computer is part of the training procedure, our method has potential to scale to larger number of qubits. Our results indicate that the WGAN model based on the quantum circuit ansatz may be effectively leveraged to enhance the quality of synthetic EBSD images on both quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware.",

Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\\mathbb Z_p\\times \\mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary \"code CFT.\" The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\\'e series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.",

We explore the effect of energy defect off of the ground state energy on the velocity field, which dictates how a particle interacts with the background of stochastic fluctuations in position, and describes how repulsive drift (negative defect) and constructive oscillation (positive defect) end a stable state as its basin of stability in the velocity field shrinks with increasing energy defect.

More sophisticated mixer-based QAOA variants restrict the search within the feasible assignments but often suffer from prohibitive circuit complexity. This paper presents a low-complexity formalism for incorporating inequality constraints into the cost function of QAOA using an oracle-based subroutine that evaluates constraint satisfaction in an additional register, subsequently called Indicator Function QAOA (IF-QAOA). The IF-QAOA cost function consists of a step-function but does not require a penalty term with additional parameters. Applied to the Knapsack problem, we demonstrate the superior performance of IF-QAOA over conventional penalty-based approaches in simulated experiments. Using advanced QAOA simulation techniques with instances consisting of up to 22 items, we find that IF-QAOA achieves significantly higher solution quality and a faster time-to-solution in 82% of our benchmark cases. Analysis of the scaling behavior shows favorable scaling of IF-QAOA compared to penalty-based methods. Also, benchmarked against the recently developed Quantum Tree Generator QAOA for Knapsack Problems, we demonstrate higher solution quality for circuits of similar complexity. Additionally, the paper introduces a method for approximate indicator function when the number of ancillary qubits is limited. With a specialized simulation algorithm based on projective measurements, we empirically demonstrate that a fixed number of ancillary qubits is sufficient to encode general inequality constraints.",

We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.",

Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a \"self-acceleration\" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading.

    "summary": "Ultrafast single-photon pulses with tailored time-frequency properties are highly attractive for quantum information science, offering high-dimensional encoding and compatibility with integrated optics platforms. However, accurate characterization of such pulses, including spectral coherence, remains challenging because current methods require substantial experimental resources and complex reconstruction algorithms. Here, we introduce frequency-bin interferometry for reconstructing electric fields with low intensity (FIREFLY), a technique that directly provides spectral amplitude, phase, and coherence profiles of single-photon pulses without requiring intensive reconstruction algorithms. Our approach measures the two-point spectral correlation function of the pulse by interfering its different frequency components using a quantum pulse gate (QPG) driven by a reference pump pulse. We demonstrate its compatibility with quantum light by characterizing partially coherent pulses generated by a type-0 parametric down-conversion process. We also overcome this requirement of a known pump pulse by introducing spectral shear into our interferometric scheme using a multi-output QPG (mQPG). This enables simultaneous characterization of a single-photon-level input pulse alongside an unknown pump pulse. Notably, our method achieves theory-experiment similarity above 95\\% across all retrieved profiles, which demonstrates the reliability of this scheme for quantum information applications based on time-frequency encodings.",

Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity.

We demonstrate the ability to robustly find optimal graph colorings for chromatic numbers up to the number of distinct Rydberg states used, in our case $k=3$. We analyze the impact of both the long-range potential tails and residual inter-state interactions, proposing encoding strategies that suppress errors in the resulting ground states.

The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable.

Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.",

Using the standard variational form of QAOA requires a high number of circuit parameters that have to be optimized at a sufficiently large depth, which constitutes a bottleneck for achieving a potential scaling advantage. The linear-ramp QAOA (LR-QAOA) has been proposed to address this issue, as it relies on only two parameters which have to be optimized. Based on this, we develop a method to estimate suitable values for those parameters through extrapolation, starting from smaller problem sizes (number of qubits) towards larger problem sizes. We apply this method to several use cases such as portfolio optimization, feature selection and clustering, and compare the quantum runtime scaling with that of classical methods. In the case of portfolio optimization, we demonstrate superior scaling compared to the classical runtime.",

    "summary": "Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.",

We fill this gap by studying standard probes of full ETH in ergodicity-breaking quantum circuits, presenting numerical and analytical results for interacting integrable systems. These probes can display distinct behavior and undergo a different scaling than the ones observed in ergodic systems. For the analytical results we consider an interacting integrable dual-unitary model and present the exact eigenstates, allowing us to analytically express common probes for full ETH. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences and show how the presence of solitons dictates the behavior of ETH-related quantities in the dual-unitary model.

    "summary": "Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.",

We develop a method to analytically bound the value of steering functionals under local hidden state (LHS) models by employing a generalized inequality for the eigenvalues of positive semidefinite operators, extending classical results such as the Samuelson inequality. This yields universal upper bounds on the LHS value in terms of the parameters defining the frame. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of these bounds in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and demonstrate the possibility of unbounded quantum violations of steering inequalities.

Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.",

    "summary": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics, making it resistant to future computational threats, including quantum computers. While QKD technology shows great promise, its widespread adoption depends heavily on its usability and viability, with key rate performance and cost-effectiveness serving as critical evaluation metrics. In this work, we report an integrated silicon photonics-based QKD system that achieves a secret key rate of 1.213 Gbit per second over a metropolitan distance of 10 km with polarization multiplexing. Our contributions are twofold. First, in the quantum optical layer, we developed an on-chip quantum transmitter and an efficient quantum receiver that operate at 40 Gbaud/s at room temperature. Second, we designed a discrete-modulated continuous variable (DM CV) QKD implementation with efficient information reconciliation based on polar codes, enabling potentially high-throughput real-time data processing. Our results demonstrate a practical QKD solution that combines high performance with cost efficiency. We anticipate this research will pave the way for large-scale quantum secure networks.",

    "summary": "The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.",

In principle, as the number of QAOA layers approaches infinity, the solutions should reach optimality. On the other hand, short-depth QAOA circuits are known to have limited performance. We show that using tailored initialization techniques encourages the convergence to the desired solution state at lower circuit depths with two and three QAOA layers, thus highlighting the importance of adapting quantum algorithms in the noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) quantum computing era. Moreover, for NISQ devices with limited qubit connectivity and circuit depth, we introduce a heuristic noise-resilient variant of QAOA predicated on the elimination of long-range 2-qubit interactions in the QAOA layers whilst the cost function is unaltered. Our results show that this QAOA variant is surprisingly effective, outperforming QAOA on a physical IBM Quantum computer device.",

    "summary": "Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.",

    "summary": "In ultrafast experiments with gas phase molecules, the alignment of the molecular axis relative to the polarization of the interacting laser pulses plays a crucial role in determining the dynamics following this light-matter interaction. The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting pulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited molecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions, the signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or averaged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the experiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in the molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured experimental signal. Here, we calculate the laboratory frame transient electronic first-order polarization ($P^{(1)}$) spectra in terms of separated molecular frame and laboratory frame quantities. The laboratory frame polarizations are compared with orientation-averaged Quantum Master Equation (QME) calculations, demonstrating that orientation-averaging captures only the isotropic contributions. We show that our formalism allows us to also evaluate the anisotropic contributions to the spectrum. Finally, we discuss the application of this approach to achieve ultrafast quantum state tomography using transient absorption spectroscopy and field observables in nonlinear spectroscopy.",

By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99\\%.

However, the generation of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement can be extremely efficient, but its utility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a scheme to combine the best of both qubit and CV approaches: a systematic method to download useful many-qubit entanglement from the efficiently generated CV cluster states. Our protocol is based on one-bit teleportation of the qubit correlation encoded in the displaced Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill basis. To characterize the practical performance of our scheme, we develop an equivalent circuit to map dominant CV errors to single-qubit preparation errors. Particularly, we relate finite squeezing error to qubit erasure, and show that only 5.4 dB squeezing is sufficient to implement robust qubit memory or quantum computation (QC), and 11.9 dB for fault-tolerant QC.

    "summary": "The Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan (CDJ) stochastic path integral formalism (Chantasri et al. 2013 and 2015) characterizes the statistics of the readouts and the most likely conditional evolution of a continuously monitored quantum system. In our work, we generalize the CDJ formalism to arbitrary continuously monitored systems by introducing a costate operator. We then prescribe a generalized Pontryagin's maximum principle for quantum systems undergoing arbitrary evolution and find conditions on optimal control protocols. We show that the CDJ formalism's most likely path can be cast as a quantum Pontryagin's maximum principle, where the cost function is the readout probabilities along a quantum trajectory. This insight allows us to derive a general optimal control equations for arbitrary control parameters to achieve a given task. We apply our results to a monitored oscillator in the presence of a parametric quadratic potential and variable quadrature measurements. We find the optimal potential strength and quadrature angle for fixed-end point problems. The optimal parametric potential is analytically shown to have a \"bang-bang\" form. We apply our protocol to three quantum oscillator examples relevant to Bosonic quantum computing. The first example considers a binomial codeword preparation from an error word, the second looks into cooling to the ground state from an even cat state, and the third investigates a cat state to cat state evolution. We compare the statistics of the fidelities of the final state with respect to the target state for trajectories generated under the optimal control with those generated under a sample control. Compared to the latter case, we see a 40-196% increase in the number of trajectories reaching more than 95% fidelities under the optimal control.

Traditional approaches suffer from readout crosstalk for a neutral-atom quantum processor with a tightly spaced array. Although classical machine learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can improve fidelity, they are computationally expensive, making it difficult to scale them to large qubit counts. We present two simpler and scalable machine learning algorithms that realize matched filters for the readout problem. One is a local model that focuses on a single qubit, and the other uses information from neighboring qubits in the array to prevent crosstalk among the qubits. We demonstrate error reductions of up to 32% and 43% for the site and array models, respectively, compared to a conventional Gaussian threshold approach. Additionally, our array model uses two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and four orders of magnitude fewer multiplications and nonlinear function evaluations than a recent convolutional neural network approach, with only a minor (3.5%) increase in error across different readout times. Another strength of our approach is its physical interpretability: the learned filter can be visualized to provide insights into experimental imperfections. We also show that a convolutional neural network model for improved can be pruned to have 70x and 4000x fewer parameters, respectively, while maintaining similar errors. Our work shows that simple machine learning approaches can achieve high-fidelity qubit measurements while remaining scalable to systems with larger qubit counts.",

For this reason there is great interest in augmenting backup navigation systems such as inertial navigation systems (INS) with additional modalities that reduce positioning error in the absence of reliable GNSS. Magnetic-anomaly navigation is one such approach, providing passive, non-jammable navigation through periodic position fixes obtained by comparing local measurements of Earth's crustal field against known anomaly maps. Despite its potential, existing MagNav efforts have been limited by magnetometer performance and platform noise; solutions addressing these problems have proven either too brittle or impractical for realistic deployment. Here we demonstrate a quantum-assured MagNav solution based on proprietary quantum magnetometers with by a novel denoising and map-matching algorithms. The system fits on fixed-wing drones or in the avionics bay of a commercial airliner. We present trials at altitudes up to 19000 feet, testing onboard and outboard quantum magnetometers comparing against a strategic-grade INS. Our MagNav solution achieves superior performance, delivering up to 46x better positioning error than the velocity-aided INS; the best final positioning accuracy we achieve is 22m or 0.006% of the flight distance. Airborne trials consistently achieve at least 11x advantage over the INS across varying conditions, altitudes, and flight patterns. The system learns model parameters online without special vehicle maneuvers providing robustness to various configuration changes (e.g. changing payload or latitude). Our trials also include the first successful MagNav performed in a ground vehicle using publicly-available anomaly maps, delivering bounded positioning error 7x lower than the INS, with both systems in strapdown configuration.",

In this study, we analyzed QUBO formulas for three coloring-related problems: the graph coloring problem, the clique vertex cover problem, and the integer-length job scheduling problem.

Within these frameworks, many imaginarity measures for finite-dimensional systems have been proposed. However, for imaginarity of Gaussian states in continuous-variable (CV) systems, there are only two known Gaussian imaginarity measures, which exhibit prohibitive computational complexity when applied to multi-mode Gaussian states. In this paper, we propose a computable Gaussian imaginarity measure $\\mathcal I^{G_n}$ for $n$-mode Gaussian systems. The value of $\\mathcal I^{G_n}$ is simply formulated by the displacement vectors and covariance matrices of Gaussian states. A comparative analysis of $\\mathcal{I}^{G_n}$ with existing two Gaussian imaginarity measures indicates that $\\mathcal{I}^{G_n}$ can be used to detect imaginarity in any $n$-mode Gaussian states more efficiently. As an application, we study the dynamics behaviour of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states in Gaussian Markovian noise environments for two-mode CV system by utilizing ${\\mathcal I}^{G_2}$. Moreover, we prove that, ${\\mathcal I}^{G_n}$ can induce a quantification of any $m$-multipartite multi-mode CV systems which satisfies all requirements for measures of multipartite multi-mode Gaussian correlations, which unveils that, $n$-mode Gaussian imaginarity can also be regarded as a kind of multipatite multi-mode Gaussian correlation and is a multipartite Gaussian quantum resource.",

    "summary": "Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource to generate nonlinearity in quantum circuits and create high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of broken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the superconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.",

    "summary": "We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle quantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this model, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of three discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal coin state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put, depending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these particles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares, acquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a three-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code is implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for syndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme achieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the encoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.",

In open quantum systems (OQS), such bounds have been principally affected by system environment coupling. In the recent past, drives on OQS have shown to give rise to drive-induced dissipation (DID). In this work, we investigate how DID affects the quantum speed limits. To this end, we use a recently-reported quantum master equation that takes into account environment fluctuations and provide a closed form estimate of drive-induced dissipation. On such a system, we use Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to find optimal route to move from an initial state to a desired final state. Our key result is that there exists an optimal evolution time that maximizes fidelity. This work enables robust quantum control in open systems, addressing a key challenge in scaling quantum technologies.

    "summary": "Quantum state purification, a process that aims to recover a state closer to a system's principal eigenstate from multiple copies of an unknown noisy quantum state, is crucial for restoring noisy states to a more useful form in quantum information processing. Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on stabilizer operations, which are classically simulable protocols critical for error correction but inherently limited in computational power. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classically simulable operations for quantum state purification. We demonstrate that while certain classically simulable operations can enhance fidelity for specific noisy state ensembles, they cannot achieve universal purification. We prove that neither deterministic nor probabilistic protocols using only classically simulable operations can achieve universal purification of two-copy noisy states for qubit systems and all odd dimensions. We further extend this no-go result of state purification using three and four copies via numerical computations of semidefinite programs. Our findings highlight the indispensable role of non-stabilizer resources and the inherent limitations of classically simulable operations in quantum state purification, emphasizing the necessity of harnessing the full power of quantum operations for more robust quantum information processing.",

Moreover, the spectra of stochastic $N \\times N$ matrices are additionally restricted to a subset of the unit disk, called Karpelevi\\u{c} region, the shape of which depends on $N$. We address the question of whether the spectra of generators, which induce Markovian evolution in continuous time, can be bound in a similar way.

    "summary": "Quantum computing is rapidly evolving its capabilities, with a corresponding surge in its deployment within cloud-based environments. Various quantum computers are accessible today via pay-as-you-go cloud computing models, offering unprecedented convenience. Due to its rapidly growing demand, quantum computers are shifting from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant model to enhance resource utilization. However, this widespread accessibility to shared multi-tenant systems also introduces potential security vulnerabilities. In this work, we present for the first time a set of novel attacks, named together as the QubitHammer attacks, which target state-of-the-art superconducting quantum computers. We show that in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum system, an adversary with the basic capability to deploy custom pulses, similar to any standard user today, can utilize the QubitHammer attacks to significantly degrade the fidelity of victim circuits located on the same quantum computer. Upon extensive evaluation, the QubitHammer attacks achieve a very high variational distance of up to 0.938 from the expected outcome, thus demonstrating their potential to degrade victim computation. Our findings exhibit the effectiveness of these attacks across various superconducting quantum computers from a leading vendor, suggesting that QubitHammer represents a new class of security attacks. Further, the attacks are demonstrated to bypass all existing defenses proposed so far for ensuring the reliability in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers.",

On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \\sim \\sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.",

We derive lower bounds to distance-like measure from the set of fully separable states based on spin-squeezing inequalities. These are nonlinear expressions based on variances of collective spin operators and are potentially close to optimal in the large particle-number limit, at least for models with two-particle interactions. Concretely, we apply our methods to equilibrium states of the permutation-invariant XXZ model with an external field and investigate entanglement at nonzero temperature close to quantum phase transition (QPT) points in both the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic cases. We observe that the lower bound becomes tight for zero temperature as well as for the temperature at which entanglement disappears, both of which are thus precisely captured by the spin-squeezing inequalities. We further observe, among other things, that entanglement arises at nonzero temperature close to a QPT even in the ordered phase, where the ground state is separable. This can be considered an entanglement signature of a QPT that may also be visible in experiments.",

X 13, 021007 (2023)], and compare their results with our high-precision calculations. We systematically investigate inaccuracies in physical results arising from numerical instability during diagonalization and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution. We find that these instabilities arise from a large condition number that scales exponentially with system size due to the NHSE, signaling strong non-normality. Strikingly, a reliable spectrum alone is shown to be insufficient for accurate non-Hermitian evolution, while the reliability of wave functions plays a more critical role. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating the condition number to ensure the validity of numerical studies on systems with NHSE, implying that some prior numerical findings in this area may require careful reexamination.",

Photon-number--dependent property of hopping rates triggers a topological phase transition in the extended SSH chain, converting the defect mode into a topological channel that directionally pumps photons between microwave and optical cavities. This mechanism leverages Rydberg blockade-enhanced photon-superatom couplings to establish a robust energy transfer channel, achieving high-efficiency photon conversion under realistic decoherence. Our theoretical framework demonstrates how topological protection synergizes with Rydberg-mediated light-matter interactions to realize a robust quantum transducer, providing a scalable platform for noise-resilient quantum networks and frequency-multiplexed quantum interfaces.",

The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier cycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable frequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps. These topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each photonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability in frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous topological lasers.

While many voices highlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to the conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue that technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful ethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on De Jong & De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I clarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I contend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding of what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by extension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement capacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts - tend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics. Instead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach: fostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis for ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic requirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for participation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical expertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing not only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.",

    "summary": "The emergence of exotic charge density wave (CDW) alongside ferrimagnetism materials opens exciting new possibilities for quantum switching, particularly in field-tuning CDW electronics. However, these two phenomena often compete and rely heavily on strong electronic correlations. While carbon nanowire arrays have been experimentally shown to exhibit ferromagnetism above 400 K, our research shows that encapsulating a linear carbon chain (LCC) within zigzag boron nitride nanotubes (BNT) induces a short-range CDW state under a competing effect of ferrimagnetism and magnetic frustrations. However, for this exotic feature to occur, the LCC needs to break the symmetry along the circular plane of the BNT. Then we utilize a Monte Carlo model to identify the optimal length of LCC@BNT to tackle its size effect, while also comparing the stability of chains provided by carbon nanotubes. The shorter LCC@BNT displays a more prominent long-range CDW pattern with a tunneling barrier of 2.3 eV on the Fermi surface, transitioning into an unconventional insulator. Meanwhile, magnetic frustrations disappear, and ferrimagnetism remains stable up to 280 K. Our discovery of ferrimagnetic CDW carbyne insulators, which function without conventional periodic lattice distortion, spin-orbit coupling, or complex d and f hybridization represents a groundbreaking shift in thinking, which demonstrates that such exotic properties are not exclusive to transition metal elements. We anticipate that spin fluctuations in LCC@BNT could enable fine-tuning of the CDW pattern, and applying an electric excitation of 2.3 eV triggers an abrupt insulator-to-conductor transition for quantum switching applications.",

    "summary": "High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of > 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to > 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to > 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.",

The circuit comprises two main components: the first prepares the initial state from the product state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes L}$, where $L$ is the system size; the second consists of $M$ layers of brick-wall unitaries simulating time evolution. The evolution times, encoded as the rotation angles of quantum gates in the second part, are optimized variationally to minimize the energy. The SSH model exhibits two distinct topological phases, depending on the relative strengths of inter- and intra-cell hopping amplitudes. We investigate the evolution of the energy, entanglement entropy, and mutual information towards topologically trivial and nontrivial ground states. Our results find the follows: (i) When the initial and target ground states belong to the same topological phase, the variational energy decreases exponentially, the entanglement entropy quickly saturates in a system-size-independent manner, and the mutual information remains spatially localized, as the number of layers increases. (ii) When the initial and target ground states belong to different topological phases, the variational energy decreases polynomially, the entanglement entropy initially grows logarithmically before decreasing, and the mutual information spreads ballistically across the entire system, with increasing the number of layers. Furthermore, by calculating the polarization, we identify a topological phase transition occurring at an intermediate circuit layer when the initial and final target states lie in different topological characters. Finally, we experimentally confirm this topological phase transition in an 18-site system using 19 qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer provided by Quantinuum.",

Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential.   In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low-loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300 K to 2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode (TE11n) enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant - both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications.

We show that the magnetron motion can be controlled through the rotating wall driving and treated as the driving oscillator. The Coriolis force couples with the magnetron motion and induces vibration in the axial direction or the $z$ direction. The center of mass motion of the ion crystal in the axial direction could be precisely detected by the entanglement between the spins of the ions and the harmonic motion through lasers. The frequency of the magnetron motion needs to meet that of the axial motion under certain conditions and thus the axial motion could be tuned to the resonance peak for maximum detection signal. We gave the parameter spaces for the meeting of the magnetron frequencies to that of the axial frequencies.

In this work, we propose a new PEC-type strategy that can provably achieve the asymptotically optimal key rate. The key piece for this is a virtual protocol based on the universal source compression with quantum side information, which is of independent interest. Combined with the reduction method to collective attacks, this enables us to directly estimate the phase error pattern rather than the estimation via the phase error rate, and thus leads to asymptotically tight analyses. As a result, the security of any permutation-symmetrizable QKD protocol gets reduced to the estimation problem of the single conditional R\\'enyi entropy, which can be efficiently solved by a convex optimization.",

The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.",

However, as tasks grow more complex, NNs often require large numbers of trainable parameters, which increases computational and energy demands. Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) offer a promising alternative: they leverage quantum mechanics to capture intricate relationships and typically need fewer parameters. In this work, we evaluate NNs and VQCs on simple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, examining models with different parameter sizes. We simulate VQCs and execute selected parts of the training process on real quantum hardware to approximate actual training times. Our results show that VQCs can match NNs in performance while using significantly fewer parameters, despite longer training durations. As quantum technology and algorithms advance, and VQC architectures improve, we posit that VQCs could become advantageous for certain machine learning tasks.",

    "summary": "Mid-circuit measurements used in quantum error correction are essential in quantum computer architecture, as they read out syndrome data and drive logic gates. Here, we use a heavy-hex code prepared on a superconducting qubit array to investigate how different noise sources impact error-corrected logic. First, we identify that idling errors occurring during readout periods are highly detrimental to a quantum memory. We demonstrate significant improvements to the memory by designing and implementing a low-depth syndrome extraction circuit. Second, we perform a stability experiment to investigate the type of failures that can occur during logic gates due to readout assignment errors. We find that the error rate of the stability experiment improves with additional stabilizer readout cycles, revealing a trade-off as additional stability comes at the expense of time over which the memory can decay. We corroborate our results using holistic device benchmarking and by comparison to numerical simulations. Finally, by varying different parameters in our simulations we identify the key noise sources that impact the fidelity of fault-tolerant logic gates, with measurement noise playing a dominant role in logical gate performance.",

    "summary": "Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\\;\\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.",

The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits.

Furthermore, a suite of novel optimizations are introduced which complement the new partial Trotterization technique, including reinforcement learning for complex unitary decompositions and high level Hamiltonian analysis for unitary reduction.

As an application, the average heat can be used as a general non-Markovinity measure for unital maps. Moreover, a positive-semidefinite temperature naturally emerges in an out-of-equilibrium ergotropy-based scenario. Concerning the infinitesimal average work, it arises as the infinitesimal variation of ergotropy, as well as an extra passive work contribution in the case of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As illustrations, we consider the thermodynamics of a single-qubit open system in the cases of generalized amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels.",

With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term goal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM) techniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices has been a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising approaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a graph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture for practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without the requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of the quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated expectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits adhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network is mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate noise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training data is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the computational overhead.

The authors leave as an open question the challenge of formulating a unified theorem that could encompass the principles of both and unify them. We unify these two theorems into a single, comprehensive theorem, extending it to the most general case by considering correlations with a general mixed-state reference system.

The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter.

Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied.

Consequently, the capacity of quantum devices to amplify the privacy of a weak source of randomness, in cases unattainable by classical methods, constitutes a practical advantage. One of the theoretical models of such weak sources are the so-called Santha-Vazirani (SV) sources; however, finding natural sources satisfying the SV model is a paramount challenge. In this article, we take three significant steps on the way to simplify this hard task. We begin with an in-depth analysis of the mathematical background for estimating the quality of a weak randomness source by providing a set of axioms that systematize the possible approaches to such estimation. We then develop software (SVTest) to estimate the parameter characterizing the source's randomness. The software is general-purpose, i.e., it can test the randomness of any target sequence of bits. Later, we apply the software to test seismic events (earthquakes and local noise) as potential sources of randomness. Our results demonstrate that seismic phenomena are possible sources of randomness, depending on the choice of discretization. Therefore, our work provides strong evidence of the potential of geophysical phenomena as a source of cryptographic resources, building an unprecedented bridge between both fields.",

    "title": "Identifying and mitigating errors in hole spin qubit readout",
    "summary": "High-fidelity readout of spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots can be achieved by combining a radio-frequency (RF) charge sensor together with spin-to-charge conversion and Pauli spin blockade. However, reaching high readout fidelities in hole spin qubits remains elusive and is complicated by a combination of site-dependent spin anisotropies and short spin relaxation times. Here, we analyze the different error processes that arise during readout using a double-latched scheme in a germanium double quantum dot hole spin qubit system. We first investigate the spin-to-charge conversion process as a function of magnetic field orientation, and configure the system to adiabatically map the $\\lvert \\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle$ state to the only non-blockaded state. We reveal a strong dependence of the spin relaxation rates on magnetic field strength and minimize this relaxation by operating at low fields. We further characterize and mitigate the error processes that arise during the double-latching process. By combining an RF charge sensor, a double-latching process, and optimized magnetic field parameters, we achieve a single-shot single-qubit state-preparation-and-measurement fidelity of 97.0%, the highest reported fidelity for hole spin qubits. Unlike prior works and vital to usability, we simultaneously maintain universal control of both spins. These findings lay the foundation for the reproducible achievement of high-fidelity readout in hole-based spin quantum processors.",

    "summary": "We combine classical and quantum Machine Learning (ML) techniques to effectively analyze long time-series data acquired during experiments. Specifically, we demonstrate that replacing a deep classical neural network with a thoughtfully designed Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) in an ML pipeline for multiclass classification of time-series data yields the same classification performance, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. To achieve this, we use a VQC based on a single qudit, and encode the classical data into the VQC via a trainable hybrid autoencoder which has been recently proposed as embedding technique. Our results highlight the importance of tailored data pre-processing for the circuit and show the potential of qudit-based VQCs.",

    "summary": "We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density   of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations depending on the choice of 2-bein in the   interaction Hamiltonian. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian   behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic   thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein respectively. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking   effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation   decreases it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence   near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case   of scalar field. We also show that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have   similar behaviour with those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. Conclusions   are discussed.",

    "summary": "Quantum computers show potential for achieving computational advantage over classical computers, with many candidate applications in the domains of chemistry and materials science. We consider the well-studied problem of configurational analysis of materials and, more specifically, finding the lowest energy configuration of defective graphene structures. This problem acts as a test-case which allows us to study various algorithms that are applicable to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) problems, which are generally classically intractable exactly. To solve this problem, we implement two methods, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Annealing (QA), on commercially-available gate-based and quantum annealing devices that are accessible via Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS) models. To analyse the performance of these algorithms, we use a toolbox of relevant metrics and compare performance against three classical algorithms. We employ quantum methods to solve fully-connected QUBOs of up to $72$ variables, and find that algorithm performance beyond this is restricted by device connectivity, noise and classical computation time overheads. The applicability of our approach goes beyond the selected configurational analysis test-case, and we anticipate that our approach will be of use for optimisation problems in general.",

They do not create would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review this with a classical automaton consisting of an Ising spin chain which is then related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Based on this and generalizing, we construct a new ``Necklace of Necklaces'' automaton with a torus-like topology that lends itself to represent the Dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions. Special attention has to be paid to its mass term, which necessitates this enlarged structure and a particular scattering operator contributing to the step-wise updates of the automaton. As discussed earlier, such deterministic models of discrete spins or bits unavoidably become quantum mechanical, when only slightly deformed.",

    "summary": "In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, the quasiparticle-related losses in Josephson junctions are suppressed due to the gap in the superconducting density of states which is much higher than the typical energy of a microwave photon. In this work, we show that a strong drive even at a frequency lower than twice the superconductor gap parameter can activate dissipation in the junctions due to photon-assisted breaking of the Cooper pairs. Both the decay rate and noise strength associated with the losses are sensitive to the dc phase bias of the junction and can be tuned in a broad range by the amplitude and the frequency of the external driving field, making the suggested mechanism potentially attractive for designing tunable dissipative elements. We also predict pronounced memory effects in the driven Josephson junctions, which are appealing for both theoretical and experimental studies of non-Markovian physics in superconducting quantum circuits. We illustrate our theoretical findings by studying the spectral properties and the steady-state population of a low-impedance resonator coupled to the driven Josephson junction: we show the emergence of non-Lorentzian spectral lines and broad tunability of effective temperature of the steady state.",

Its real part, the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), has a measurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguishability. However, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental inaccessibility of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here we introduce a counterpart to the QGT that includes measurement operators, termed the \\textit{semi-classical} geometric tensor (SCGT). We show that the SCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover, we use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss extensions of the Berry phase.",

Below we demonstrate that in some recent literature the application conditions of the Lifshitz theory established by its founders are violated by applying it at too short separations and using the dielectric permittivities possessing the negative imaginary parts in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.",

    "title": "Variational Quantum Machine Learning with Quantum Error Detection",
    "summary": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that promises advantages such as faster training, improved reliability and superior feature extraction over classical counterparts. However, its implementation on quantum hardware is challenging due to the noise inherent in these systems, necessitating the use of quantum error correction (QEC) codes. Current QML research remains primarily theoretical, often assuming noise-free environments and offering little insight into the integration of QEC with QML implementations. To address this, we investigate the performance of a simple, parity-classifying Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) implemented with the [[4,2,2]] error-detecting stabiliser code in a simulated noisy environment, marking the first study into the implementation of a QML algorithm with a QEC code. We invoke ancilla qubits to logically encode rotation gates, and classically simulate the logically-encoded VQC under two simple noise models representing gate noise and environmental noise. We demonstrate that the stabiliser code improves the training accuracy at convergence compared to noisy implementations without QEC. However, we find that the effectiveness and reliability of error detection is contingent upon keeping the ancilla qubit error rates below a specific threshold, due to the propagation of ancilla errors to the physical qubits. Our results provide an important insight: for QML implementations with QEC codes that both require ancilla qubits for logical rotations and cannot fully correct errors propagated between ancilla and physical qubits, the maximum achievable accuracy of the QML model is limited. This highlights the need for additional error correction or mitigation strategies to support the practical implementation of QML algorithms with QEC on quantum devices.",

Specifically, we show that to implement a monomial of degree \\( n \\), where \\( n \\) is odd, it suffices to choose powers of a primitive \\( n \\)-th root of unity as QSP phase angles.   Our approach departs from standard numerical methods and is rooted in a group-theoretic argument.   Being fully analytical, it eliminates numerical errors and reduces computational overhead in QSP implementation of odd monomials.   Such use cases arise, for example, in quantum computing, where self-adjoint contractions are embedded into unitary operators acting on extended Hilbert spaces.",

Here, the algorithm leverages the unique ability of a neutral atom tweezer platform to realize arbitrary qubit position configurations. These configurations determine the degree of entanglement available to a variational quantum algorithm via the interatomic interactions. Good configurations will accelerate pulse optimization convergence and help mitigate barren plateaus. As gradient-based approaches are ineffective for position optimization due to the divergent $R^{-6}$ nature of neutral atom interactions, we opt to use a consensus-based algorithm to optimize the qubit positions. By sampling the configuration space instead of using gradient information, the consensus-based algorithm is able to successfully optimize the positions, yielding adapted variational quantum algorithm ansatzes that lead to both faster convergence and lower errors. In this work, we show that these optimized configurations generally result in large improvements in the system's ability to solve ground state minimization problems for both random Hamiltonians and small molecules.",
